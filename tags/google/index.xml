      <description>Hugo&amp;rsquo;s watching web server is great for creating pages. Tweak a little and see the browser refresh. (Unless you break things and then it is still just a manual browser refresh away from back to the good state, once your page is unbroken.)
As I was developing local pages, I happened to have my realtime Google Anaytics open. I noticed I was hitting it. I would have assumed that it would be disabled if running locally.</description>
