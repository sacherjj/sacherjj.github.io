      <description>or How not to look Stupid and Burn Down a House Note: This was an article written for a now defunct site about film making. Thus, the intended audience of the article were low budget independent filmmakers. I wrote this to address may of the problems I witnessed on various sets. However, this applies to everyone that uses extension cords for anything.
This article is going to be a little technical and possibly boring to some, but the subject is important.</description>
