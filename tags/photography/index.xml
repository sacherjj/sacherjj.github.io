      <description>I had been planning on driving down to see the eclipse for a few months. My wife&amp;rsquo;s aunt lives directly in the totality region. We were unsure until the last day if we could make the trip, but headed down on Sunday.
We were able to visit and have a nice slow Monday morning, before the big show.</description>
