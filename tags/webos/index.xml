      <title>The Windows Phone Experiment is Over</title>

      <description>My wife and I left webOS when HP flushed their 3 year plan to revamp webOS down the toilet. We tested both Android and Windows Phone. Android is a multitasking joke. Coming from webOS, it has a terrible UI. Windows Phone has very nice flowing UI. We decided to go to Windows Phone.
Microsoft representatives promised to get phones and development credits to webOS programmers. Despite many requests, it turned out to be a bunch of hot air.</description>

      <title>Zune Podcasts - A Rant</title>

      <description>Zune podcast functionality on Windows Phone Mango was obviously designed by someone who never listens to podcasts. I’ve tried to use it over the last three weeks and it is an exercise in futility. There is one glaring problems that needs to be addressed before it is close to usable. It all comes down to episode management. Unfortunately, this is the most important factor of any podcast solution.

      <title>Windows Phone Podcast Experience</title>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Mango&amp;rdquo; update for Windows Phone, or version 7.5 for those less fruity, adds many features. This article is dealing with the podcasting capabilities. On webOS, I made daily use of a brilliant piece of software called drPodder. Moving from this almost clairvoyant app to the integrated podcast ability of Windows Phone is quite jarring.
I will be outlining the current successes and fails with Windows Phone which keep it from being an enjoyable podcasting experience.</description>

      <title>webOS to Windows Phone - What&#39;s Missing?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring both Android and Windows Phone as possible replacements for my nearly dead Palm Pre. HP killed future hardware and we need phones, bad. I purchased an HTC Arrive off eBay, slightly cheaper than I would get it from Sprint under contract. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it as a WiFi only device for about a week. Wednesday night, I upgraded it to the developer&amp;rsquo;s release of Mango, the future update for Windows Phone.</description>

      <title>Multiple Google Calendars on Windows Phone (Mango)</title>

      <description>With webOS, Synergy just happened. (OK, it didn&amp;rsquo;t just happen. Many engineers spent many hours making this work seamlessly. But to the user, it &amp;ldquo;just happened&amp;rdquo;.) You don&amp;rsquo;t realize how nice this is, until you try a system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have it. Windows Phone 7 with NoDo (the current &amp;ldquo;up to date&amp;rdquo; version for the public) has this problem.</description>

      <title>Encoding Videos for the HP Touchpad</title>

      <description>This post is for those who have ripped their DVDs and other video media and would like to load it onto their HP Touchpad. I started to encode videos for the HP Touchpad using HandBrake, which had given me success for video targeting my Palm Pre. I used iPad profiles, as the display size is exactly the same. It seemed that no matter what I tried, the files would not show up in Photos &amp;amp; Videos app.</description>

      <title>Hacking can be bad for your Kindle App&#39;s Health</title>

      <description>If you feel like following my hacking example to load .mobi format books onto the Touchpad&amp;rsquo;s Kindle App, be ready to have to reload it. If the app has a problem parsing the book for any reason, you are done. With no back gesture on the Touchpad, there is no way to back out of the crashed book load. Each time you start the app, it will load the file into a crash situation.</description>

      <title>Touchpad Keyboard - Good, Bad, and Ugly</title>

      <description>While there is no doubt that software for the HP Touchpad is in its infancy, it is hard not to see the great usefulness and potential. There are a few good writing apps for the Touchpad, including those for WordPress blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m composing this in the WordPress App for WebOS tablet. Any of these are much easier to use with a hardware keyboard, than attempting to type quantity on a virtual keyboard.</description>

      <title>Loading mobi books into Touchpad&#39;s Kindle App</title>

      <description>I have purchased many ebooks and created others manually in the .mobi format. This is very easy to load onto my Kindle device to read. Unfortunately, the current Kindle app on the Touchpad does not allow loading ebooks other than downloading from Amazon. This is unfortunate and makes the Touchpad a poor replacement for my Kindle.</description>

      <title>Touchpad WiFi - Hidden Passcode Hell</title>

      <description>I have just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get our complex 64 character WPA key into my HP Touchpad so I can start the setup procedure. The password field for the WiFi key is frustrating.
The last character is only shown for a second or two, then it too fades into the dots of obscurity.</description>

      <description>July 1st is the day that many WebOS users have been waiting for. The day that HP releases their first WebOS tablet, the Touchpad. I preordered through Amazon and was delivered my own spanking new HP Touchpad tablet this evening.
Overall it is an amazing piece of technology. Slicker than any Android tablets that I have tried, but not quite as polished as an iPad. However, for me the usability is far above an iPad, whose &amp;ldquo;multitasking&amp;rdquo; is a joke compared to the Touchpad.</description>

      <title>WebOS From Homebrew to Catalog: tips learned in the process</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer, on many different platforms, for just under two decades. Like many code monkeys, I enjoy learning new architectures. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure why, but programming for WebOS has me more excited than I&amp;rsquo;ve been since working with GCC on the Palm Personal. The idea of building apps with web technologies on a portable device sounded interesting. I knew that certain things would be easy and others hard.</description>

      <title>TouchStone Theories Confirmed</title>
      <link>http://joesacher.com/blog/2011/02/22/touchstone-theories-confirmed/</link>

      <description>Precentral.net read through the initial TouchStone theory post I put up and asked HP about my theories.
As they posted in this article on the site, HP confirmed the identification to work as I assumed.
The new TouchStones will use the 3.1 MHz frequency to pass a unique key to the new WebOS phones, which will enable them to know where it is docked. You will obviously have to tell the phone where each dock is located the first time you use it.</description>

      <title>WebOS Touchstone - Now and Future</title>
      <link>http://joesacher.com/blog/2011/02/15/webos-touchstone-now-and-future/</link>

      <description>When the Palm Pre was released, Palm also sold a unique inductive charger called the Touchstone. Inductive charging isn&amp;rsquo;t new, by any means. Electric toothbrushes and many other devices have used them in the past. This was a first for cell phones, I believe.
When I purchased my Pre and eventually many Touchstones, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good oscilloscope to play around with the signals.</description>
