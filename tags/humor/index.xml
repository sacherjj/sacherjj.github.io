      <description>Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids. Yes, it sounds weird. I don’t understand how they made it through marketing. I don’t think they had any type of focus group for these. I have a rule that I will try anything once, as long as there isn’t a high likelihood of death. I think this is why blowfish is so expensive, for the malpractice insurance for those that die after eating it. I don’t plan on trying blowfish any time soon.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, I am easily bored.
My mind wandered during a meeting at work today as we were talking about leveraging your strengths. So I started drawing on my notepad.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a geek, no doubt about it. Only a geek would notice that today is special. The date is 2^1&amp;frasl;2^2&amp;frasl;2^3 or 2/4/08. At 4:32 PM or 16:32, we have a time of 2^4:2^5. Sadly there are not 64 seconds.
Yes, and I AM aware that most places that describe dates in a sane way (like everywhere but the US), will have this day in April. :)  So enjoy a fun power of two date/time sequence that will not happen again for a hundred years.</description>
