      <description>Why Rust for Me I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming in Python for quite a few years. It is a great language for getting things done. There are so many modules and batteries included. You can do most things by selecting the right package. However, no one will tell you that it is fast. Unless you are talking about the speed to write code.
I started looking at new languages to learn as a way of growing as a programmer.</description>

      <description>The Bencode format is an interesting design. It is byte based, which makes it safe from big-endian and little-endian translations. Somewhere when reading about how torrents worked, I got looking at their file format.
As far as I know, the Bencode format isn&amp;rsquo;t used on anything but torrent files. The format is pretty simple, with only 4 different data structures: Byte String, Integer, List, and Dictionary.
Bencode Basics Byte String This is formatted as [integer length]:[byte string].</description>
