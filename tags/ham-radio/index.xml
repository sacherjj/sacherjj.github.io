      <description>I studied for a month or so and re-learned quite a bit of electronics for AC circuits. Resistance, Reactance, Polar Impedance.

I was licensed in 1990 and expired in 2000. Just when I was starting work in the &amp;ldquo;Real World&amp;rdquo;, outside of college. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother renewing.</description>
