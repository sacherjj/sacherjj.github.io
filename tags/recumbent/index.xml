      <description>I am almost fully equipped for touring on my Vision Recumbent with a BOB trailer for cargo. However, I really think a good camp seat would be nice. The only problem with that is the weight must go up the hills. The seat on the Vision is removable by loosening the back mount and removing the bottom pivot mount.</description>
