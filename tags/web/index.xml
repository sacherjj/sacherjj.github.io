      <description>Goal In converting my Pelican blog over to Hugo, I needed to learn a new templating system. I miss a few things that Pelican did, like categories based on folders and not front matter. However, I can see advantages of allowing more organization in these folders, without affecting final position on the web.
One glaring miss was the idea of series links. I have been trying to add photos and complete conversion of my travel journal into posts for my Trans-Am bicycle trip in 2002.</description>

When my Word Press was hacked and defaced yet again, I finally decided to rebuild my website with a static generator and host on GitHub. I leaned towards Pelican, due to the Python base that I thought I could modify if I needed. And I hoped that I could get it to work easily.
I did get everything converted over to .</description>
