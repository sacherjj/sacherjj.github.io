<p class="caption">June at the famous water sign</p>
</div>
<p>I woke up at around 8 <span class="caps">AM</span>, when June came into the bike house.  She told me not to get up, but I told her to come on in.  We sat and talked for an hour about some of the people that had come through before and about how modern times are so much different than old times.  I was able to talk with June a couple of times throughout the day and had a good time during each conversation.</p>

<p class="caption">Looking at my bike in the bike house “lobby”</p>
</div>
<p>Quite a bit of today was taking pictures of as much as I could in the bike house.  There were many travel journals and books that I would like to read, but there just wouldn’t be enough time to read that much in a whole week.  I started “copying” these by taking digital pictures of each page.  It was a pretty quick process, but there were so many pages and articles that I wanted to read.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMERY -->
<p>I sat down again, dumped my memory cards to the laptop, and wrote in my journal.  But the end of the day, I had taken over 1100 digital pictures from things in the house.  This will take some time to sort out, but I will be glad that I get a chance to read some of them once the tour is over.</p>

<p class="caption">Hope watering the new plants around the labrynth</p>
</div>
<p>I went up to visit Hope and look at the start of her Labyrinth.  She is building it on top of a hill behind their house.  The following is from an information sheet she left in the bike house:</p>

<p class="caption">Center of the labrynth</p>
</div>
<p><em>The seven circuit labyrinth design is believed to be 4500 years old.  The first example is found carved on the wall of a Neolithic tomb from ancient Sardinia.  The design, however seems universal.  It appears in many different cultures from all over the world.  This same design appears on 3500 year old coins from Crete, tablets and pottery from both ancient Greece and Rome, an 11th century manuscript from India and labyrinths believed to be from the 12th century have been found carved in rock on Hopi reservations in Arizona.</em></p>

<p class="caption">Fresh plants that will form the labrynth</p>
</div>
<p><em>The labyrinth represents the path each of us takes in our own lives.  It winds and turns its way in on a unicursal line.  This means that there are no false turns or dead ends - just one way into to the center and back out again by the same path.  It is a walking meditation, a metaphor for the course of our lives, and a powerful tool for solving problems.</em></p>
<p><em>As you walk the labyrinth you turn this way, then that, shifting 180 degrees each time.  It is thought that this is the reason it can induce receptive states of consciousness.  As each physical shift occurs, your awareness changes from right brain to left brain, and there is an equal number of turns in each directions.  Each person has a unique experience in the labyrinth.  Some walk it for guidance, some for clearing the mind, others for centering and gathering their thoughts.  Whatever the purpose, most find a connection to their spiritual core.</em></p>

<p class="caption">View off the mountain at the labrynth</p>
</div>
<p>I found it relaxing to walk the path. Before today, I didn’t know the difference between a labyrinth and a maze.  I had always thought that they were different names for the same thing.  A labyrinth only has one path in and out, where a maze has many paths and some of which are false.</p>

<p>Hope has started planting lavender around the labyrinth and will eventually complete the entire thing in lavender.  Not only will it be pretty, but the fragrance should be amazing.  The very center of the labyrinth is the first time I stopped looking down at the path and looked up.  Wow.  The mountain view is amazing.  They did pick a perfect place for this.</p>

<p class="caption">Ben, Kami and Dove’s photo from June’s photo book</p>
</div>
<p>June recently learned that a couple who had come through over a month ago were in an accident.  They had an 11 month old, making her just over a year old at the time of the accident.  Kami, Ben and their daughter Dove are all going to be fine.  From what I understand, Ben was pulling a trailer with Dove and Kami was pulling a trailer with their gear when they were hit by some vehicle.  Both bikes and trailers were ruined, but Dove didn’t have a scratch.  The parents were a little banged up, but only bruises and some gravel rash and no broken bones.  It is a blessing that no-one was seriously injured.</p>

<p class="caption">My bed for the two nights at the Bike House (and a nap)</p>
</div>
<p>I came in to the bike house and had a toaster pastry and tuna fish sandwiches.  Then I sat down on the couch.  I decided to lay down on the couch for a bit and was woken up by thunder.  Looking outside, the thunderstorms and rain had started.  I went back to the couch and dosed a little more.</p>

<p class="caption">June showing me around the bike house</p>
</div>
<p>June came in at around 3 <span class="caps">PM</span> and was taking a man and woman from the local cycling club through the house for the first time.  I was able to record some of her explanations of some of the memorabilia and get pictures of what she was talking about.  It was great to hear a few of these stories and imagine how many more stories were represented by all of the pictures, articles, post cards, and cycling gear in the house.</p>

<p class="caption">June and I</p>

<p>I purchased one of her books with anecdotes about various people she has met.  She is going to ship it to my parents, so I don’t have to carry it up the hills and mangle it in my panniers.</p>

<p class="caption">Water for cyclists, which means the world after a long, hot climb</p>
</div>
<p>I had planned on leaving for a short day, but the rain continued all evening.  My legs were happy for my first day with no miles.  I’m hoping the weather clears up for tomorrow, just so I can see the sights from the Blue Ridge Parkway.  I’m going to try to get out of here before 7 <span class="caps">AM</span> for a decently long day tomorrow.  I have about 2000 feet of climbing before I reach the peak of the Blue Ridge Parkway, then it is all up and down riding.</p>

<p class="caption">Train tracks just down the hill from the bike house</p>
</div>
<p>June assured me that the worst climb of the trip is the one up to Afton mountain.  She said that those riding West to East comment on Virginia being the hardest state of all.  This is even for those who are in shape after 3,500 miles of riding.  Today I commented on my legs not liking the hills, June confused my physical soreness for my mental resolve and tried to assure me that I could make it across.  I told her that I have no doubt in my mind that I can.  My body is starting to morph into a hill climber.  It isn’t there yet, but I can already feel the changes starting.</p>

<p class="caption">Bike House log, with the Pete’s message above mine.</p>
</div>
<p>I came back inside the house and started taking more pictures.  I wound up shooting more than 1100 picutes of the bike house and page “copies” since I’ve been here.  I had some Spaghetti O’s with Meatballs and some Peas.   June keeps the bike house stocked with food for us bikers.  She has a donation jar for optional donations.  Those are the only thing that keeps this house going.  I will be leaving her a sizable one for the two most enjoyable days of my tour so far.</p>
<p>I took photos of the Pete’s and my Polaroids and also the sign in sheet.  The Pete’s left a note for Adam and I.  After I signed, I also left a note for Adam.  Sign in books are one great way of seeing how far ahead the faster cyclists are than you.  I would start to see people who passed me and by the difference in dates, get an idea of how they were doing in progress.</p>

</div>
<p>Jim (Hope’s husband) came down into the bike house around 7 <span class="caps">PM</span> and invited me up to their home.  June was up there having a hot dog roast.  I had already eaten, so I didn’t have a hot dog, but I did really enjoy myself talking with them next to the clay pot fire.</p>

<p>They had a cool little clay fireplace that looks like a big pot with and opening and a chimney on top. It works really well for a small fire for roasting under their front porch. We sat enjoying the evening and listening to the rain fall through the trees.  I roasted a marshmallow and had a piece of apple pie.  The conversation was great and so were the mountain views.  One of the best part of this trip was the many nice people I met along the way.</p>
<p>I said my goodbyes as it got later.  It was time to start packing up and getting ready to leave in the morning.  I had to take my laptop down to the rail road bridge to get enough signal to send out my journal updates.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that I’ve been on this trip for over a week now.</p>

  <p>I'm a Electrical Engineer by degree, Software Engineer by experience, and someone who loves to learn new things. I have a quick wit that it is often too corny. I'm good at thinking outside of the box, because I often don't realize one exists.</p>
