            <p>This is something often attributed to Paul Harvey.  While Paul often read material from this author, he was not the author.  This was written by Lee Pitts in <em>People Who Live at the End of Dirt Roads</em> that appeared in the 2000 <em>Chicken Soup for the Golden Soul</em>.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>For my grandchildren, I’d like better. I’d really like for them to know about  hand-me-down clothes, homemade ice-cream and meat loaf sandwiches. I really would.</p>
<p>My cherished grandson, I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that  you learn honesty by being cheated.  I hope you learn to make your bed and mow the  lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you  are sixteen. I hope you have a job by then.</p>

<p>It will be good if at least one time you can see a baby calf born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in. I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother.  And it’s all right if  you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he’s scared, I hope you let him.  When you want to see a Disney movie  and your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you’ll let him.</p>
<p>I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope your driver doesn’t have to drop you two blocks away so you won’t be seen riding with someone as uncool as your mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your  dad teaches you to make one instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books. When you learn to use those newfangled computers,  I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head.</p>
<p>I hope you get razzed by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what Ivory soap taste like.  May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. I hope you get sick when someone blows cigar  smoke in your face. I don’t care if you try beer once, but I hope you don’t like it.  And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he’s not your friend.</p>
<p>I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your grandpa and go fishing with your uncle.  May you feel sorrow at a funeral and the joy of holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through the neighbors window and that she hugs you at Christmas time when you give her a plaster of Paris mold of your hand.</p>
<p>These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness.</p>
<p>Written with a pen.”</p>
