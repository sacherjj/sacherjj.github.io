&lt;p class="caption"&gt;I’ll be describing the construction of the gray panniers located directly under my seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find a pannier set that works exactly as I would like for the under-seat rack on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.   I like the panniers made by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.panniers.com"&gt;Arkel&lt;/a&gt; of all the panniers I have looked at and used.  However, it was impossible to find a size that worked exactly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make my own set tailored (quite literally) exactly to my needs and I borrowed quite a bit from Arkel’s design work.  Below is a description of the process for those who would like to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bicycle panniers are designed for normal upright bicycles.  Good panniers have been designed to never contact the rider’s feet.  At the very least this interference would be annoying.  At the worst, it could cause an accident.  It is very important to check clearance in all odd positions you can encounter on your bicycle, as frame locations and distances vary with every bicycle.  Does a fully turned front fork with the foot forward catch, etc.  Since I am designing a bag for use under my seat on a recumbent, foot strike issues are not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/WholeSetup.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dining room table pannier production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first debated tapering the bottom of the bag.  I couldn’t come up with a reason to do that.  My previous panniers for the under-seat rack were Arkel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;-30’s.  These are normally used as front panniers and are tall and skinny.  My biggest problem with using them on the under-seat rack is the occasional dragging while turning at faster speeds (i.e. using more lean).  I also wanted quite a bit more storage under the seat, to get as much weight low and forward as possible.  A rectangular design will be the absolute easiest shape I can build.  It also will be an efficient use of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lessons Learned: It might have been a little better to design the bag such that the bottom is level with the ground in the riding position.  Notice in the first picture above that the portion of the pannier towards the rear is lower than the front.  If I gave the pannier a little more height in the front and less in the back, I would have a slightly more optimized design for this cycle, without the bag ground strike issues I will talk about later in this article.  Keep factors like that in mind as you design your custom bag.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mocked up a pannier using a corrugated plastic back plate and paper, to check the size and clearance when the bike was leaned over to 45 degrees.  I should never get that far over while turning, but it gives me a decent safety factor.  I decided on a size of 18” long, 12.25” tall, and ~6” deep.  The zipper sections have the most seams and allowances, so I wasn’t sure what the exact final depth would be.  I planned on using a 1/2” allowance seams for everything, except for the specialized seams on the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how much time I saved by spending the hour making the mock up. It does wonders in increase your confidence about actually creating this thing.  I was able to finalize mounting hardware location as well, eliminating putting holes through the fabric in the wrong place with the final bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lessons Learned: Again on the issue of ground strike.  When measuring that 45 degree clearance, give a generous 3-4” buffer from the ground.  This is to take into account that the bag &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; sag under weight and more than you think.  Well at least more than I thought, but you might be smarter than me.  (Hopefully you are after reading this!)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="construction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased most of my raw materials from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.therainshed.com/"&gt;The Rain Shed&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good source for outdoor patterns and fabrics.  I would recommend anyone starting out making outdoor equipment to pick up Sew and Repair Your Outdoor Gear by Louise Lindgren.  I ordered it along with my fabric from the Rain Shed and it was easily worth the $17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/HeatSeal.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Using a cheap soldering iron to melt the threads together at the edge where the fabric was cut, to prevent unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using a 1000 Denier Cordura for the main fabric of the pannier.  The Cordura I used is the gray fabric in the pictures.   I need 4 pieces of fabric for the main body of the pannier:  The front of the pannier (which I define as the side facing away from the bike), the back and bottom, and the two pieces that make up the sides and top.  Both of the side and top pieces run parallel with each other, with a zipper in between them.  All this should make more sense as you start to see pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with the side/top pieces, because they would take up most of the width of the fabric.  I wanted the strength of the fabric (the warp) to be along the short dimension of the pieces, so they have to be cut with the long axis parallel to the weft.  (Warp are the threads running the length of the fabric, Weft are those running “back and forth”.)    The dimensions for my two side pieces are 7.5” x 44” and 1.5” x 44”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 325px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SmallSideZipper.jpg" style="width: 325px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side zipper seams from the outside, indicated in red.  Notice first seam is inside the fold and second seam secures the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that the most important things to do with synthetics after cutting is heat sealing.    You don’t want you bags to unravel during use and scatter all of my contents across the road!  For most thin synthetics, you can use a good hot knife for both cutting and sealing.  While I’ve used a hot knife for thin nylon, I would guess that it would be hard to cut fabric this thick  without leaving a large hard edge of melted nylon.  I used a cheap soldering iron for sealing the edges of the Cordura, after cutting out with very sharp sewing scissors.  This didn’t leave hard edges, but secured the fibers well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYK&lt;/span&gt; size 10 coil zipper for the pannier.  The size 10 is about the largest you can get and should wear very well.  The coil zipper will run around the curves of the pannier much better than a toothed zipper and the strengths are about equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 333px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SmallSideZipperBack.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side zipper seams from the inside, indicated in red.  Notice the fabric just sticking out past teh zipper from the first seam, before the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the small side piece.  The first seam is stitched with the wrong side of the zipper and fabric out.  I used a zipper foot to stitch along the zipper, leaving enough room for the large sliders.  After the first seam was finished, I pulled the fabric back, so the right side was facing up and stitched the second seam using the regular foot against the zipper (the spacing worked out just right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the pictures, you can see the two seams indicated with red lines.  The first image is from the right side of the zipper and the second from the wrong side.  Just above the red lines in the wrong side picture, you can see a little of the folded over fabric sticking out.  I tried to line up the edges of the zipper and fabric for the first seam.  This wandered just a little on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 152px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SeamRipReflector.jpg" style="width: 152px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Seam ripping the reflector off, because I sewed it on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the seams in the pannier I used a nylon thread.  From what I have read, cotton can rot and the nylon fibers of the Cordura will cut polyester.  I used heavy duty nylon thread through out the pannier construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 285px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SideReflector.jpg" style="width: 285px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side reflective tape combo picture, low light without flash fading into flash picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step for the larger side piece is sewing on the reflector strips, made from 3M reflective fabric tape.  I located them so they would be halfway up the side.  Also, don’t get distracted and sew the reflector on the wrong side.  Surely no one would be that stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was concerned about the exposed edge of the reflective tape at first. After sewing a piece to a scrap of fabric and scratching over it for quite a while with my fingernails, I was unable to get the tape to unravel any significant amount.  I think it should hold up fine without rolling over the top edges.  Any time the ends of the tape are exposed, however, they need to be folded under before being sewn.  For these side pieces, both edges will be covered by edging on one side and a seam to the back on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SidePieces.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Both piece of the side/top of the pannier.  These will run 3/4 of the way around the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a laugh out of the shot with the flash was on.  The reflective tape seems to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left you can see the two side pieces.  The smaller piece is finished, except for being joined to the front panel.  While it looks like it curves, this is only because of the zipper seam pulled that edge of the zipper together, making it shorter.  This will go away after you sew along the other side of the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 286px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSideWide.jpg" style="width: 286px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side parts showing edge detail for front and rear reflectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger piece has both piece of reflector tape sewn in place (on the correct side!).  One edge of the larger side piece will be exposed, because it is acts as a flap for the zipper.  I used 3/4” cross-grain nylon ribbon to treat the edge.  This looks much nicer than a raw edge and should also keep it from unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 144px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SecondZipperStitch.jpg" style="width: 144px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Both stitches on the large side piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it easier to sew this edge when I folded the tape and ironed it, before sewing.  By “I found it easier”, I mean by not ironing the ribbon in half, it is close to impossible to sew it nicely.  With it ironed, it is just really difficult.  I pined it in place every 6 inches or so, as I sewed the edge.  You can’t pin too far ahead, because the tape adjusts length a little as you sew.  This edge will also contain one of the exposed reflective tape ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSide.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Finished side pieces, zipped together.  The left side with the flap laying down as it will normally be to protect the zipper from debris and water.  The right side has the flap lifted to show the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish the large side piece, I ran a second stitch along the zipper.  I again used the zipper foot for one and regular foot for the other, to maintain consistent spacing.  I then installed the two zipper pulls.  When the pannier is closed, the two pulls will be together.  It will open like a back pack, with the two zippers pulling away from each other to make an opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is cutting out the front panel and joining it to the smaller of the side pieces.  The dimensions for the front panel are 19” x 13.25” (18” x 12.25” finished).   Again, you want to cut out the shorter dimension along the weft of the fabric, allowing the stronger warp threads to be vertical in the pannier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedFront.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front sewn to small side piece and zipper half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the piece is cut out and heat sealed, you join it to the shorter side piece on three edges, leaving one of the longer edges exposed to join with the back/bottom piece.  I lined up the pieces at the tip center, but sewed to as one long seam with two turns.  See the image of the finished side and front joined together.  All that is left is to sew in the back panel pouch, join the back on, cut the back panel, bent and install the aluminum support, and install the mounting hardware.  In other words, we aren’t even half way there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 400px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedFrontAndSide.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front and Side zipped together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add a mesh pocket for holding things I need while riding and drying wet stuff.  I could have done this along with the side seams to the front, but I wanted a smaller pocket.  I also wanted the bottom of this pocket to be a few inches above the bottom of the pannier to keep it from sagging down and possibly dragging in turns.  Both of these made sewing the pocket on a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSideWithPulls.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Details of the dual zipper pulls, prior to joining the short side to the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister came over and got excited about the project.  Ruth is more experienced at sewing than I am, but this the first “industrial” sewing project for either of us.   She helped me figure out how to attach the mesh pocket.   I used elastic across the top, folded over and stitched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 426px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/PinningMeshPocket.jpg" style="width: 426px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pinning the mesh pocket onto the outside prior to sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sewed on the pocket with the same cross-grain ribbon I used on the zipper cover and mitered edges at the corner.  There were a few places that… umm… missed the tape.  But she re-did those.  I’m going for functionality, not beauty. Beauty wouldn’t be bad though.  I can’t say much, because she actually sewed them on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, I was fairly tough with the low power of my machine.  If I keep up this type of work, I’ll want to pick up a lightweight industrial machine.  A machine that sews straight with plenty of power is the best option.  We didn’t pull the elastic along the top enough with the first piece.  Sewing down elastic takes out some of the retracting capability.  One pocket will be slightly more loose than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other lesson learned is that it would have been easier to sew on the pocket before sewing the front to the sides.  On my second bag, I sewed the netting along with the front and side/top seams.  It turned out cleaner and was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUCH&lt;/span&gt; easier.  It also yields a larger pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One negative of this is the it sticks out a little more and can get damaged easier.  I have a small tear in mine from a slight drag with a little too much weight in the mesh pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SupportHolder.jpg" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Internal pocket on the back side to hold the stiffener board.  Where the black nylon ends at the bottom is the transition from back to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut back/bottom piece at 19” x 21” (finished 18” x 12.25” back and 18” x 7.75” bottom.)  Again, this was heat sealed all around the edge.  The warp ran along the 21” direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before sewing onto the sides/top, I wanted to put in a pocked for the stiffener.  This was cut from lightweight black nylon and sealed, 19” x 13”.  The sides of the pocket will be sewn into the seams.  I rolled over and hemmed the top to get a clean edge.  I rolled over the bottom before sewing to the Cordura.  The top remains open to load in the support panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done much sewing, you know there is that one time when everything is going right.  You have been fighting seams all day and this seam is the best one so far.  It is straight and the fabric is laying perfectly.  That only means one thing, you bobbin just ran out of thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 186px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/EmptyBobbin.jpg" style="width: 186px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sew all you want, but when the thread runs out in the bobbin you are just punching holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sides of the back/bottom piece are sewn to the exposed edges of the front/sides/top piece.  I centered the sides/top piece along the top of the back/bottom piece and sewed that first.  This distributed the sides evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all simple seams of keeping the fabric aligned and sewing at the right offset.  However, because of all the hardware on the individual pieces, it takes some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 323px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedPannier.jpg" style="width: 323px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pannier with sewing finished, before support hardware was added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the side pocket, you can see a small strip of reflective tape.  Were I smart about it, I would have sewn this reflector along the entire edge of the front piece and into the seam at the side.  This would be a larger reflecting surface and eliminate the need to fold over the ends of the tape to sew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 234px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/PlasticSupport.jpg" style="width: 234px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;1/8” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDPE&lt;/span&gt; plastic sheet for hook support mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attentive reader might also have figured out that these pannier could be made with a single piece for the back, bottom, and front.  I had thought of this at first, but decided the likely hood of me lining everything up correctly with essentially two “U” shaped pieces of fabric (with the sides/top and the back/bottom/front) might be zero.  My main concern was the unknown zipper seam offset.  This would vary the thickness and make the bottom piece width vary.  However, if you sewed together the side/top pieces and them measured the finished width, you could easily create a one piece back/bottom/front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.arkel-od.com/en/bicycle-accessories.html"&gt;hook kit from Arkel&lt;/a&gt; for mounting the panniers to the bike.   This consists of two hooks up top, with a cam locking mechanism that locks the hooks onto the rack rail.  Then an elastic hook holds onto the bottom of the rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of this mounting method requires support inside the pannier.  My dad had a piece of 1/8” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDPE&lt;/span&gt; plastic that would work.  I used some cardboard to prototype the support size before cutting plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/OnBike.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Test fit in location on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scored the plastic with a razer knife and then folded it over to break the edge, similar to cutting drywall.   I used a jigsaw to round over the corners of the sheet, then I cleaned up the edges with sand paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 315px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/RoundingCorners.jpg" style="width: 315px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rounding the corners with a jigsaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounting requires two holes in the support panel.  I locked the clips on the rack and positioned the bag where I wanted it to mark the hole positions.  I used the soldering iron to melt through the back fabric and into the plastic, then drilled holes in the support.  Last, I melted the hole in the back fabric to match the size of the drilled hole.  I was careful to not melt into the nylon pocket material.  After I tightened the nylock nuts for the hooks, I made sure to clean off any edges that might cut in the pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last design element I borrowed from Arkel is the support rod.  This takes the force from the front of the pannier and distributes it to the back, where the hooks transfer the load to the bike.  If this rod was not installed, the weight in the pannier would allow the outside edge of the bottom to drop until the contents stopped compressing and the top and front took up the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 337px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SupportRod.jpg" style="width: 337px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Support rod bent from 1/4” solid 6061 aluminum.  It is important to keep the edges that meet the top of the pannier well radiused to spread the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rod is 1/4” 6061 solid aluminum rod.  We started bending at one edge.  First the piece that will go into the webbing pocket, next the section goes along the side, then the portion along the top, next the other side, finally the webbing pocket piece on the far side.  The side edge length isn’t critical, as long as they are equal.  They should be as long as possible, however, because that will reduce the angle it makes with the back.  The greater this angle becomes, the more force is pushed into the bike, rather than just down on the hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 473px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/TopRodHolder.jpg" style="width: 473px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Top rod holder sewed to the top/side.  It is mounted back enough that the force in not on the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sewed in the top rod holder first.  This is the most critical one for positioning.  For material, I use a light weight 200 Cordura, which I had on hand.  It doesn’t match, but no one ever sees it.  After cutting the piece, I rolled over and stitched the shorter edges before sewing it into place.  Care should be taken to get this as parallel as possible with the back edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that when the piece is pulled out firmly, it does not reach the zipper.  If it does, extra force will be focused directly on the zipper.  I’ve talked with zippers quite a bit, they don’t like this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 355px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SideRodHolder.jpg" style="width: 355px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;One side rod holder located at the bottom back. The other side is the same, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom holder consists of 3/4” nylon webbing, which is folded over and stitched along the edge to form a pocket.  You don’t have to get the exact length right, but you want to get the fold correct.  Once you sew this portion, you can cut the overall length to leave just a small margin to sew it to the bag.  To find the position for these, install the rod inside the top holder and mount the pannier on the bike.  Fake some force in the pannier top and figure out where it needs to me positioned to get the top level with some force on it.  If you didn’t get the two sides equal when bending the rod, here is where you correct any small problems.  Just make sure to mark the rod so it goes in the same way each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my bag is much wider than the pannier I modeled this after, I wanted to beef up the support.   I cut and added the 45 degree webbing reinforcement when I sewed the pocket.   With that, I was done.   I put it on the bike and loaded it down to ride for a few days.  I was worried that I would have to tie directly to the plastic sheet, but even after touring for months the attachment I used was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my 70+ days on the bike, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joesacher.com/category/trans-am.html"&gt;during my Trans-Am tour&lt;/a&gt;, I learned a few things.  The overall design and construction was sound.  The bags are pretty decent at shedding water and held up pretty well to carrying the bulk of my touring load.  A few things didn’t work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I under estimated the tilt angle that I might need to make on the bike, after the bags sagged slightly with heavy load.  I would use 60 degrees as a measure next time, instead of 45 degrees.   Obviously, if you make them shallower, this becomes less of a factor as well.  This was augmented by the second problem, the bottom drooped.  Not  all loads I put in there were a flat 18” x 7” pieces of baggage.  I don’t think any were.  This causes the bag to get close enough to the ground that I did touch a few times at speed.  Cordura fabric is considered abrasion resistant.  However they aren’t talking about the type of abrasion that pavement gives at 40 mph on a downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad met me two times on tour and I had him bring some equipment to solve these problems.  We glued some light aluminum sheet to the outside rear edge, where I occasionally touched down, to form skid plates.   We also put some corrugated plastic sheet in the bottom of the pannier.   I oriented the channels along the short axis to keep the bottom from curving as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process was a great learning experience that I would only do again if I couldn’t find something commercially available close to what I wanted.  It is nice to personalize things, but these bags were a great deal of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBOrigDryBag.jpg" style="width: 205px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dry bag for inside panniers, purchased from Arkel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched without success for a lightweight, waterproof bag to protect my Martin Backpacker Guitar.  Typical dry bags used for water sports are overbuilt for bicycle touring and backpacking use, where weight is a very large factor.   They use clear vinyl or heavier vinyl coated cloth and weigh many pounds.  This article describes the process I went through to make my own custom lightweight waterproof bags for touring and backpacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- PELICAN_SUMMARY_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered a set of front panniers and some lightweight waterproof bags to use in the panniers from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.panniers.com"&gt;Arkel&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the “roll over and snap” type closure of the dry bags I received.  In these bags, I saw the perfect material to produce a travel guitar dry bag.   I asked Arkel about getting a custom bag made, but they turned me down.  Their supplier did not have the flexibility for a custom project.  The design of these bags is dead simple, so I decided to just make one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is my first attempt at making the bag and shows a large collection of what not to do if you attempt the same thing.   Hopefully there are enough tips that you will be successful.  You should be able to follow this page to make waterproof bags for any shape you want to, even simple squares. Although, If Arkel carried the size I wanted, I would probably just purchase it from them as the cost for materials and time to build a bag makes their prices really reasonable.  Just remember to leave the biggest side open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-fabric"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fabric&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had posted to the phred.org touring group (no long around) about waterproof bag material and was referred to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.therainshed.com/"&gt;The Rain Shed&lt;/a&gt;.  They turned out to be a very helpful resource on harder to find fabrics for outdoor gear.    I started with the huge sample set, knowing I would soon need additional material for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joesacher.com/blog/how-to/how-to-build-bicycle-panniers/"&gt;custom bicycle panniers I also had planned&lt;/a&gt;.  I purchased a small amount of some 70 Denier Taffeta and 200 Denier Oxford Heat Seal Fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 200 was almost exactly the same weight as my existing dry bags, and the 70 looked a little too light and would be puncture too easily.   It is more like a very thin jacket lining that would have addition reinforcement.  My bag would not have that luxury.  I ordered 2 yards of the 200, some 3/4” plastic side release buckles, and some 3/4” flat nylon webbing.  The dry bags from Arkel used 1” buckles, but 3/4” is sufficient, as there really isn’t any load on them and the smaller size allows for a tighter roll.  Get the thinnest webbing you can find.  Again, no force is really involved here and thinner webbing is easier to sew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-template"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 164px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTemplate.jpg" style="width: 164px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Cardboard template for dry bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 246px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTemplate2.jpg" style="width: 246px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dry bag material template beside guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taped together some cardboard pieces to create a template for the guitar.  The template is around 2 inches larger than the guitar.  This extra area is need for both the material to seal and the thickness of the guitar.  This was just a guess on my part, but make sure to guess bigger than needed.  It is easier to seal in further and cut off excess than to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used two small pieces of double stick tape to keep the template from shifting as I cut it.  I would have produced a more even and cleaner cut if I used masking tape around the edges and cut through it.  Just make sure when you cut the material that you don’t pull it.  The more you let it lay without tension, the more accurate you can follow the template. Years later, I started woodworking and found out about carpet tape.  This is a fiber backed extreme double stick tape.  It is all I use for most projects, instead of the cheap foam tape shown in the pictures.  You can find it at most big box stores, such as Lowes, Home Depot, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 221px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBDblStickTape2.jpg" style="width: 221px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A few pieces are all you need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 202px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBDblStickTape.jpg" style="width: 202px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Standard Foam Double-Stick tape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guitar looks just about right laying over the first side cut out.  I set up for cutting the second side with my template same side up as it was in the last cut. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;’T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAY&lt;/span&gt;!  I was lucky that my template was fairly symmetrical, but I had to twist the bag at certain places to make the sides line up when sealing.  If you flip it over when cutting the second side, they should like up perfectly.  In other words, act like the template edge of the open side is a hinge when flipping the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 90px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBCutOne.jpg" style="width: 90px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First cut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 113px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBCutOne2.jpg" style="width: 113px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Guitar over first cut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 106px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBCutTwo.jpg" style="width: 106px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Making the second cut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I did this again, I would make a half template and use that to create the full template.  With the band saw I now have access to, I would make it out of cheap 1/8” material, allow me to cut it out with a hot soldering iron or hot knife.  This would eliminate the need to seal the edges later, and I could have cranked out a couple and probably sold them (if the reaction to this tutorial is any judge of that.)  My biggest mistake on this was not taking my time to make a good and symetrical template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be useful to make a heat seal template that was 1/2” smaller all around.  This would allow you to iron and press into the template and get a uniform seal (unlike my first failure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sealing-the-edge"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sealing the Edge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 198px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBIron.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Standard iron to seal edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 230px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSeal.jpg" style="width: 230px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;What the sealed edge looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on my standard household iron and started sealing the bag.  (It was happy to be used for a change.  I love wash and wear fabrics and like to keep the iron on a shelf.)  I had played with a few scrap pieces before I started and I recommend you do the same.  The best setup I found was around 5 or 6 (my iron has 1-9) and moving a little slow.  Be sure to practice the sock technique described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first sealing attempt, I test fit the guitar.   I couldn’t have done it better if I actually &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DID&lt;/span&gt; know what I was doing. I noticed some less than satisfactory seals.   Forcing open the inside with your hand allows you to see how far in the seal has taken.  The orange arrow points out a section not sealed almost all the way out to the edge.  A good bit of this is because of the twisting that was required, because of the asymmetrical template.  Taking time on the template construction or flipping over the template when cutting out these pieces will eliminate some of this.  You are shooting for about a 1/2” of seal or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 134px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTestFit.jpg" style="width: 134px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First test fit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Example of a bad seal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some problems getting the wrinkles to seal.  The ironing board cover I was using is too soft and it didn’t hold the bottom sufficiently.  I worked slowly over the entire edge and did the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I thought that bag was sealed perfectly, wanted to test it.  How do you measure how much water gets into a bag holding something?  That is pretty hard to do.   But you can test how well it holds water.  I took it to the bathroom and filled it with water.   If it is can hold in water it should keep water out, right? As you can see, I had a problem. My haphazard method of sealing the edges needed some improvement.  I hung up the bag to dry out and try again at the sealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 259px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBLeak.jpg" style="width: 259px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Not quite there, bag is leaking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 122px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBDrying.jpg" style="width: 122px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Drying bag after water test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the drawing board.  There were two problems with my method of sealing.  First, I couldn’t rub down the edge behind the iron, because the heat seal coating really retained heat and it burned my fingers.  Solution: I just put a sock on my hand and rubbed directly behind the iron.  Second, my ironing board is too soft and the bottom fabric isn’t forced up against the top to heat up its sealing material.  Solution: I used a large piece of standard corrugated cardboard under the bag when ironing.
I should also note that it is a good idea to do some tack seals.  By that I mean do something similar to what welders do with tack welds.  Lay the bag out and use the iron to seal small sections every couple inches.  This keeps the edges from going out of alignment when you run the full “weld” down the edge.  It was at this point I realized how skewed my bag was from making a bad template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 340px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSock.jpg" style="width: 340px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Using sock to rub down the hot edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing the second sealing, I put in the guitar and trimmed the bag length down. You want to have enough length to be able to roll up the end three of four times and then make the ends touch. The bag will close like the first picture at the top of this page.  It is safer to leave the bag a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 308px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTrimLength2.jpg" style="width: 308px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rolling up bag to check length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing a better seal, the bag was water tight.  If I ran out of water bags, this would work in a pinch. I trimmed off where the two sides didn’t match up.  This is yet another reason to take time on a good template.  If you were perfect in cutting out and lining up your side, you can skip this part.   That is an easier method by far, as it is much easier to judge the true seam width if both sides are lined up before sealing.  The sizable pile of scraps when I finished up was a testimony to how poorly I did.  Time to dry out the bag again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attaching-the-clips"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attaching the Clips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 193px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSolderIron.jpg" style="width: 193px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Melting edges of webbing to keep from unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 175px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSewOn2.jpg" style="width: 175px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sewing the clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bag dried, I cut webbing pieces for attaching the clips to the bag.  With a low temperature soldering iron, I slightly melted the edges of the webbing to keep it from unraveling after the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attach, you just fold the webbing around the top edge of the dry bag and sew a zigzag stitch forward and backwards a few times.  I tested out the setting with a spare piece of webbing and on of the dry bag section I had cut off.   You need to get the length close., as your seam should be sew over  the location where the  bag is already sealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 253px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBClip.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;How to attach the clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sew into the unsealed area, you reduce the opening size in the bag and introduce many pin holes where the bag can leak.  This isn’t a large factor  in the water tightness of the bag, because of the multiple rolls.  However, I believe that having edges of a zig-zag stitch on the inside would be more likely to tear out than the uniform sealed edge.  This is a place that will be stress each time the bag is open.  It is safest to just keep the seam over the sealed region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 282px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSewOn.jpg" style="width: 282px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Clip sewn on the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both clips sew on, I am now finished.  To use the bag, you just put the guitar in, roll down the top and clip the clips together.  One thing I noticed when sewing the webbing on is the tendency for the bottom piece to walk, when the feet try to move the material.  Start the first full section of stitches by hand to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 347px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBFinished.jpg" style="width: 347px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Finished bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut the bag for length before the second sealing.  Didn’t try to fit it after the second sealing until after I sewed on the buckles.  I was so concerned with water tightness that I sealed in almost an inch, instead of the 1/2” that I originally wanted.  This created a serious problem, as my guitar will no longer slide in the bag all the way.  I sealed it really good this time, so it doesn’t want to come apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 335px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBWontFit.jpg" style="width: 335px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Over sealed, so now it won’t fit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops!  I knew this first one wasn’t going to be pretty, but I assumed it would work.  That is why I bought 2 yards.  I have used less than a 1/2 yard so far and this first attempt can be turned into a waterproof cell phone case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was written a few years ago.  I wound up not taking the Backpacker guitar with my on my bike tour.  I also no longer own this guitar or bag.  This shouldn’t keep you from making your own, however.  The one problem with this bag is the possibility of puncturing the bottom, there the neck inserts.  Cut off strings are very sharp.  My solution for this was to get a very thick wool sock that fit over the tuners.  This did two things, first it protected the water proof integrity of the bag.  This sock also protected the exposed tuners, a second unintended consequence.  Good luck if you take on this project.  With a little work, you can have a nice dry bag for any custom application that should last a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Quick Prototype of Vision Seat “Camp Chair”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am almost fully equipped for touring on my Vision Recumbent with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOB&lt;/span&gt; trialer for cargo.  However, I really think a good camp seat would be nice. The only problem with that is the weight must go up the hills.  The seat on the Vision is removable by lossening the back mount and removing the bottom pivot mount.  This should take only a minute or so to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front Quarter view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am toying with the idea of making a chair bottom for it. This would need to be 6061 aluminum to allow for the welding, but it still might weigh more than it is worth.  Here is some early sketches that I am playing around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 266px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/vision-seat-camp-chair/vs_qrear.jpg" style="width: 266px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rear Quarter view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seat bottom rear piece is a rectangle with the bottom a slightly oversized tube to allow it to pivot in the bottom triangle. This render shows the bottom folded how it would ride on the top of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOB&lt;/span&gt; trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This design never went past the 3D model stage. I now am using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket for touring, but I will keep this page here, in case someone else want to try this. Please let me know if you do! - Joe 05/23/01&lt;/p&gt;
