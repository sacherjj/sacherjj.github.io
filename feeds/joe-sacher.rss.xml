&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I was intrigued when I read the summary of this book.  A novel by John Grisham about a third string &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; quarterback, escaping his terrible past to play professional football in Italy.  Nothing about lawyers?  This sounds interesting, if not just to figure out why John described.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought about making a few to mess around with.  This would be a good project to practice some manual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; soldering skills.  I haven’t worked with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; at all.

Like many code monkeys, I enjoy learning new architectures. I’m not exactly sure why, but programming for WebOS has me more excited than I’ve been since working with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCC&lt;/span&gt; on the Palm Personal.  The idea of building apps with web technologies on a portable device sounded interesting.  I knew that certain things would be easy and others hard.  That is always the case with any platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Word Whirl queued up for release in the App Catalog, I decided it might help others to describe some of the things I’ve learned.  This is my way of giving back to all the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://precentral.net"&gt;PreCentral&lt;/a&gt; users that helped during the process of taking Word Whirl from a request post to a published application.  Hopefully this will help some more make the leap from Homebrew to App Catalog and get more apps out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Palm Pre was released, Palm also sold a unique inductive charger called the Touchstone.  Inductive charging isn’t new, by any means.  Electric toothbrushes and many other devices have used them in the past.  This was a first for cell phones, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve started writing again.  In the last few years, all my writing was on screenplay style for short films.  Some of these we actually shot and produced, most just sit on my computer in final &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; form.  Writing in screenplay format is different than novel, novella, or short story forms.  Screenplay is all about dialog and character actions.  There is no exposition of character thoughts.  I think this experience makes you a stronger dialog writer, when you switch to fiction.  I decided to read a few books on the subject of writing fiction before starting up again. Seeing good reviews on Stephen King’s &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;On Writing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, I decided to read it.  I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I realized that my recumbent would allow me to complete my dream of riding a bicycle across the country, I started research all over the web.  While reading through the many trip reports of coast to coast touring cyclists, two things became clear.  First, I would be riding the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/transamerica.cfm"&gt;TransAmerica trail&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adventurecycling.org"&gt;Adventure Cycling&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 (the year of my birth).

To make a dish, you need to look at a half dozen recipes on the subject, then go in the kitchen and cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;I’ll be describing the construction of the gray panniers located directly under my seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find a pannier set that works exactly as I would like for the under-seat rack on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.   I like the panniers made by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.panniers.com"&gt;Arkel&lt;/a&gt; of all the panniers I have looked at and used.  However, it was impossible to find a size that worked exactly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make my own set tailored (quite literally) exactly to my needs and I borrowed quite a bit from Arkel’s design work.  Below is a description of the process for those who would like to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book I happened on by chance.  I picked it out of the new book section of the library by the title and checked it out after reading the inside cover.  I’m glad that I did.  While I only rate it 4 out of 5, it was an interesting book and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched without success for a lightweight, waterproof bag to protect my Martin Backpacker Guitar.  Typical dry bags used for water sports are overbuilt for bicycle touring and backpacking use, where weight is a very large factor.   They use clear vinyl or heavier vinyl coated cloth and weigh many pounds.

&lt;p&gt;I have not found a way to better describe this book than the first sentence inside the dust cover. “It’s as if Dave Barry and Charles Kuralt squeezed together onto a bicycle to pedal across America and around the world, filing outrageous dispatches along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many times while reading I felt as if I was watching the well done Sunday morning stories where the common man or the small town are shown in all of their glory.  Those stories that aren’t as touching will give you a great laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt; was the first book of Dan Brown’s I read.  It seemed like your only choice was to read the book, due to popularity.  I really enjoy Brown’s style of writing, but didn’t like the far stretches required to make &lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt; a suspenseful novel and much of the false history.  I guess it didn’t really bug me when reading the book.  The thing that bugged me was people thinking it was the truth after reading a &lt;strong&gt;fictional&lt;/strong&gt; novel.  Despite this, when seeing &lt;em&gt;Deception Point&lt;/em&gt; for sale at our United Way book sale at work, I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deception Point&lt;/em&gt; involves the discovery of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in arctic ice in the far North.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, in dire need of a success to halt a funding cut or complete elimination of the organization, are careful to pull in civilian scientists to validate their discovery beyond a shadow of doubt.  In addition, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; analyst Rachel Sexton is brought in as a professional skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, you can no longer win $15,000 by reading this book.  It was the announcement of the solution to the 10 cipher challenges, located in the back of &lt;em&gt;The Code Book&lt;/em&gt;, that made me aware of this book.  Money aside, if you are interested in learning of the history of codes and ciphers, this book is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Mary Queens of Scots was killed by Queen Elizabeth, because her code was not strong enough to foil the code breakers of the time.  Have you ever heard of the Navajo Code Talkers that offered the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Marines a method of secure ground communications in World War &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;?  (Probably more so after the Windtalkers movie.)  Do you know the full story behind the breaking of the German’s Enigma Code in the same war?  Do you know that the first computer was build in England, not the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wish I had ran into this book before I purchased my “utility” sewing machine.  I got a no frills home machine with a few stitches.  It was a floor model, but I would have been better to spend the money on a light weight industrial sewing machine with only a straight stitch.  Louise was talking about me when she mentioned those who buy a machine with all of these cool stitches.   They play with these stitches for a month and then only sew straight seams.  I now wish I had a machine that just sews straight seams like a champ.  I’m glad I got my machine pretty cheap, as I’ll most likely upgrade now that I am having fun making stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote this to address may of the problems I witnessed on various sets.  However, this applies to everyone that uses extension cords for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped for lunch at the same bagel place I ate at yesterday.   I just wasn’t ready to get riding in the 90+ degree heat.   It seems fine when you are already riding, but hard to get going when you have been in air conditioning for the morning.  I think it is much like slowly raising the water temperature to boil a frog, where tossing them in a boiling pot will just make them jump out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jails in Palmyra, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VA&lt;/span&gt; are pretty nice.  The officer arrested me around 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; and confiscated all of my gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding!  I didn’t have any problems with camping at the boat ramp last night.  Traffic on 15 started to slow around 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; and I fell asleep shortly after sending out my emails.  I woke up just before 6 and started packing up.  I left Palmyra at 6:30 and started my race with traffic to Charlottesville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dawn quietly cracking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up just before dawn cracked at 5:45.  I had packed up everything but my sleeping gear before I went to bed, because I wanted to secure as much of it as I could from any animal or other visitors.  I was out of the campground before 6.  I still couldn’t find anyone to check in with, so I dropped off a couple singles in the slot near the closed sign, which I felt was far more than the accommodations were worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;My tent’s view of me the last two nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before willing myself out of my warm sleeping bag, I snapped a picture of my view. I rose into the cold and decided on a cold breakfast to keep with the theme.  I finished off my first pack of Fig Newtons and had a mug of Gatorade (my morning drink of choice for that last few days.) The early Gatorade seems to give my muscles what they need to start out.  I knew I would be having an early lunch, as I planned to go into Ashland today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get a chance to finish typing up my journal and answer emails before bed yesterday.  While eating and writing, the temperature dove off a cliff.  The food from my cook stove was warming for a while, but with the food and hot tea gone, night’s chill started winning the battle.  Last night was cooler than my first night on tour.  Not being near a big city might have been a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Drive into Berkley Plantation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkley Plantation was my second stop of the day.  I should point out to anyone wanting to try this route themselves that the 1/2 mile ride into Berkley is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TERRIBLE&lt;/span&gt;.  You see the sign that asks you to enjoy yourself for the next 1/2 mile of authentic Colonial road and you get to try as hard as you can to keep the bike upright.  That is one of the toughest roads I have ever ridden on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sign from Hwy 5 (John Tyler Memorial Highway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherwood Forest was the first plantation I visited today along Hwy 5.  It holds a few distinctions, such as the only private residence having been owned by two unrelated presidents.  William Henry Harrison inherited the property in 1790 and sold it in 1793 without having every lived in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Loaded and ready to go, once I stow my drying shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a good night’s sleep, despite the temperature.  I thought about not bringing my 20 degree bag and purchasing a warmer weather bag to take up less space and weight.  I’m thrilled that I didn’t talk myself into it.  I needed every bit of that bag to stay warm last night.  I woke just before 7, refreshed and with my headache gone.  I’m sure that drinking water throughout the night helped counter the dehydration and altitude effects.  I immediately went to get my $22 worth of hot shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bicycle tourist is greeted with two choices when starting their tour.  Do I ride away from my home or pack up everything and take alternate transportation to the start?  For local tours, the loop method is a good idea.  Start off in one direction and ride in a big loop until you end up back home.  If I had a year’s time, not just a couple months, I would enjoy a loop tour of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.  It would be ideal to leave Indiana, riding in the northern states during the warmer months and the southern states during the cooler months.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have the few extra weeks it would take to get to Virginia.  My dad has some good flying friends with access to a large enough plane to get us out to the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I completely loaded up my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.  I’ve built many custom components to make it into a cross-country touring machine.  Unfortunately, I haven’t had as much time getting ready for the trip as I wanted.  Work pressed into taking far too much of my time, so both equipment and physical shape preparation was lacking.  I will just have to get in shape by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just finished building my first rear wheel using &lt;em&gt;The Bicycle Wheel&lt;/em&gt; as a guide.  This book will teach you the technical aspects of the bicycle wheel in both structural principles and practical methods.  After a couple hundred miles on my new wheel, it is still true as an arrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book debunks myths and gives you the confidence to repair, build, and rebuild wheels.  I can honestly say that I no longer fear any wheel repairs.

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Quick Prototype of Vision Seat “Camp Chair”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am almost fully equipped for touring on my Vision Recumbent with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOB&lt;/span&gt; trialer for cargo.  However, I really think a good camp seat would be nice. The only problem with that is the weight must go up the hills.  The seat on the Vision is removable by lossening the back mount and removing the bottom pivot mount.  This should take only a minute or so to do.&lt;/p&gt;
