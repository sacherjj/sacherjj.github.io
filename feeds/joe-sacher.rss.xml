I started with a Ruby based solutions, thinking it would be a good time to learn.  But the only thing I really learned is that Ruby is a 2nd class citizen on Windows.
I need to do 60% of my work in Windows and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; can’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times do you think I logged into my Linux &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; to update the site?  Other than the first time?  None.  Well, actually once.  I tried, but gems had been changed and I had dependency issues and…  I just let it sit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/3.3.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; first, because I am very comfortable with Python.  And Python is 80% as nice in Windows as Unix, maybe more.  People actually care if it doesn’t work in Windows.
So I came full circle and am now generating the site in Pelican and hosting on github pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style isn’t how I want it to end up, but back online.  It will grow with time, as I add new content and port over the old content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process started with a outdated Wordpress install on a shared server, leading to compromised sites and blank sites.  One thing I’m sure of, it is better than Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

We tested both Android and Windows Phone. Android is a multitasking joke.
Coming from webOS, it has a terrible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. Windows Phone has very nice flowing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. We decided to go to Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft representatives promised to get phones and development credits to webOS programmers. Despite many requests, it turned out to be a bunch of hot air.
Sadly, this turned me off to all mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slugged along with trying to make Windows Phone a viable mobile solution for 8 months. We are done trying. After two weeks of switching to Android, we know two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android is painful to use, compared to the grace of webOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LESS&lt;/span&gt; painful than Windows Phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy podcasts. Trying to listen to them on Windows Phone is a complete nightmare. It is so bad that I stopped listening to podcasts completely.
It was one of the many things I slowly gave up, because of the lack of usability on Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a decent collection of audio books on mp3 format. There is only one way that I could make these work on Windows Phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join all mp3s in the right order into one mp3 file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the metadata to indicate podcast genre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through Zune to get it on my phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if I want to listen to other things on the device, I get to lose my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to subscribe to audio books on Audible. I stopped with webOS.
This keeps getting promised for Windows Phone. This exists for Android. Which brings us into another factor: apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dealt with the lack of apps, lack of access to hardware, lack of many things on webOS, because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; is still the best out there.
Two weeks on Android with access to some of the things I have been missing, makes up for a lot of bad &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zune slowly changed from something I have to work through to get stuff on my phone, to something that drove me completely nuts.
I setup WiFi sync, so that I didn’t have to constantly connect my phone to download podcasts and other things to it.
My Windows Phone almost never correctly download these things on its own. Oh, how many times I watched my phone indicate pending downloads that would never come to pass.
WiFi worked to finish the downloads when the software felt merciful and the moon was in the correct region of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted an annoying piece of software that was the gatekeeper for my device, I would just deal with the abomination that is iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File management is a joke. The process of getting a document on and off your phone involves crazy steps of using email, online syncs, and a bit of prayer.
I miss the former days of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive mode, where I could just copy files. Guess what? That is back with Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows Phone has the same multi-task pausing of the iPhone, it was easier to switch between apps than Android. However, if the app isn’t setup with the Mango resume,
the pause before the app resumes is annoying. Really the two platforms are pretty much tied in this race. They both have barely left the starting blocks of usability, compared to webOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the home screen of Android would be more annoying. It turns out to be less so than trying to fit all the apps you want to use on the start screen or looking them up each time in the alphabetical list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I have with Android now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps for my credit union, including deposit check via photo. Charging credit cards via a device on the headphone jack. Tethering via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; for free.
Not quite the WiFi hot spot that webOS gave me, but I can have that too if I decide to root the phone. Edit: Found FoxFi, so WiFi hot spot is back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video player that plays files I just drop on the phone via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;. No waiting 30 minutes to convert the files into the correct format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambling Book Player that takes an audio book with 250 files and handles it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeyondPod which, while not as nice as Dr. Podder on webOS, can actually manager all my podcasting needs on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audible. I have missed Audible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ScummVM is now back on my phone. I was one of the backers for Double Fine’s Adventure game on Kickstarter. I enjoy these things. It was possible with webOS, and now is again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are far from perfect on my Android transition. I have to periodically hit the optimize button to close down rogue apps.
I had to get a 3500 mAh battery to make my phone last a day. But things are better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; I found out that Zune doesn’t want me to go. I cancelled our Zune Pass. Luckily, I had a card stolen and cancelled that card as well.
Now I get an email periodically about how the card is bad. How they can’t charge a monthly fee for a service I cancelled over 2 weeks ago. Zune, the relationship is over.  We broke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one glaring problems that needs to be addressed before it is close to usable.  It all comes down to episode management.  Unfortunately, this is the most important factor of any podcast solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order is allowed, for either oldest first or newest first.  This is great.  What this means is that it will constantly download the oldest or the newest.  Doesn’t matter how many times you have heard them.
It doesn’t matter if you manually marked them as heard and manually deleted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have oldest selected, guess what is downloading back on the phone?  Do you remember those old favorites that you have manually deleted 10 times already?  Yeah, they’re back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are caught up and always listen to the latest, the moment it comes out, then having the newest set and keeping the latest X on your devices works fine.
Myself, I set almost everything to oldest, because if 2 episodes come out before I get back to that podcast, I want to hear them in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t that hard.  When a feed is added, a piece of data is tracked for each episode.  If you have downloaded and listened to a podcast, store the podcast filename or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; with a played flag.
When you are listing episodes, you put a small indicator that this is old and listened to already.  When syncing podcasts, download the oldest or newest that don’t have the listened to flag set.  Done.
This is programming, not rocket science.  The user can manually redownload them if wanted, but otherwise they are dead to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a database that remembers which are played, can we mark them as played without downloading them?  Pretty please?
Some podcasts were online before you were even a glint in your compiler’s linked binaries.  I’m at episode 140 of 200, but selecting oldest will only allow me to start at 1.
Even if episodes were marked as listened correctly, I would have to download and mark all 139 prior episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, can we ask for another great feature?  Add an auto delete after listening option.  Wouldn’t that be great?  You listen to an episode.  It is marked as played in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; and deleted.  Now what happens?
The next episode is automatically downloaded to get up to your keep at least number.  It would be almost like the software was reading my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve almost stopped listening to PodCasts on Windows Phone, because the management of episodes is more work than the enjoyment of listening to them.
Maybe it is too easy to spot really crappy software after using really great software.   If anyone wants to see really good software, look at drPodder on webOS.
It is open source, take a look.  It makes Zune’s implementation looks like a bad student programming project.&lt;/p&gt;

For this to work, I need to fully understand thermostat wiring.  It took a bit of looking around the net to identify thermostat wire colors, thermostat terminals and functions, so I thought I would summarize it in a post.&lt;/p&gt;

Android is a no holds barred knockout win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turn by turn directions in pre-Mango Windows Phone is a joke.  You must tap the screen to move along, making it totally unusable for navigation when you are driving the car.  The Mango update provides considerably increased driving instructions.
If you follow the route given, the system works very well.  If you do not, you will soon want to through your phone out your car window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used each phone’s direction solution to “find” my way to work.  Due to heavy construction, the fastest route is not obvious.  This is a good way of figuring out how annoying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; software will be, by driving in a manner that it considers idiotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first day was with Android 2.3.5.  I started Navigation, tapped Speak Navigation, and rattled off my work address.  It parsed the address correctly.  I deviated from the proposed route no less than ten times.
When I went off route, the phone didn’t utter a peep, it just recalculated a route faster than any mapping solution I have ever used.  Voice prompts were there when needed, but not annoying at all.
After determining that the routing works as well as TeleNav, this would be my preferred navigation solution on Android.  TeleNav give you a speak destination option, but it does not parse the speech to text as well as Navigate.
If you want to use TeleNav for the routing, you can let Navigate hear your location then select which you wish to use for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second day was with Windows Phone 7.5 beta.  I started Maps and tapped the directions arrow, then typed in my work address.  Then I started navigating.  No voice destination is available in Maps or TeleNav.
The routing looks fine.  Now I go off route.  My phone tells me that I have gone off track and I can tap the screen to reroute.  Excuse me?  I have to tap the screen to reroute?
Whoever came up with this idea is the same guy who puts 2 “Are you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SURE&lt;/span&gt; you want to close this App?” dialogs, when you just want to get out of the program.
So I held the phone in my hand, because I knew I would have to tap the screen after each mile or so leg, when it thinks I should get “back on track”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound up turning off Maps about halfway to work, to keep me from throwing the phone out the window.  A complete and utter usability failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android wins this round.  Still not sure if it is enough to get past the complete ease of use failure that is the Android system in general, so I’m still using both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and still missing webOS.&lt;/p&gt;

Moving from this almost clairvoyant app to the integrated podcast ability of Windows Phone is quite jarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be outlining the current successes and fails with Windows Phone which keep it from being an enjoyable podcasting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="adding-podcasts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding podcasts from the device is only possible by searching the Zune podcast library.  If the podcast does not exists in the library, you cannot add it from the phone.
If you have an obscure podcast, you can add an rss feed through the Zune desktop software.  Not at all ideal, but it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="playback-order-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playback Order (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up a podcast, you can specify the number of episodes you wish to download to the phone at a time and the order (oldest or newest first.)  This makes sense.
Some podcasts are episodic and it would be confusing to listen to them in anything but chronological order.  News podcasts might make more sense to listen to the latest first and the older if you have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you want to listen to them from oldest to newest for a podcast that has been out for years?  That brings us to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="episode-management-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Episode Management (Fail)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to many podcasts that have been around far before Windows Phone was a twinkle in a cell carrier’s eyes.  So I setup a new podcast that I am up to episode 107 on my current device.  I listen to it oldest first and set a sync of 3.
My Windows Phone will download Episodes 1, 2, and 3.  Then I can tap hold and mark as read.  However, I cannot do this until the episode is downloaded.  So the process of catching up is to download each episode and mark it as read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tap and hold an undownloaded, unplayed episode should have an option to mark as played.  Ideally, there would be some functionality to “catch up” and mark all as played.
This would be more useful in a majority of cases when you are transitioning from a device where you have been a loyal listener.  If you set all to read and then have to reset the last 2 or 3 to unread, this is still a faster experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="video-support-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Support (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Phone handles video podcasts very well.  Playback is crisp in visuals and program performance and start up time.  I don”t see anything in video that is a problem, other than the problems also common to any style podcast in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bookmarks-occasional-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bookmarks (occasional Fail)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are much longer than songs.  It is not uncommon for them to pass 90 minutes.  Most people won”t listen to them at one sitting.  The podcast player should remember time into each episode of each show to which a listener has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmarks seem to work as expected in video podcasts.  However, I have had mixed results with audio, with many times getting no bookmark.  Instead of a complete oversight, which I originally assumed, it seems to be bugs in the process.
What I am running is still beta code, so we will have to wait to see if this is addressed in the version of Mango sent down to phones.  If you play from the main screen and are careful to pause, it seems to work.  Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a2dp-bluetooth-support-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth Support (Fail)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bluetooth support on Windows Phone is woefully lacking, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; profile seems to work perfectly for any audio only component.  When you bring video into the mix, nothing you do will make audio stream through your Bluetooth device.
This affects video podcasts along with all video on the device, including YouTube, local videos, and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you will watch no video on the phone, you will find &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; to satisfy you.  But with only partial support, you have no choice other than to use wired headphones if you consume any video at all.  This makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="streaming-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streaming (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to listen to an episode that you have not downloaded, no problem.  Streaming the episode worked great for both audio and video playback.  As long as you used those wired headphones for the video, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="control-from-other-apps-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control from Other Apps (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows Phone is not anywhere close to the multitasking that was enjoyed in webOS, they control of audio playback while moving around other apps works well.
If you at inside another application and wish to pause playback (or other controls, such as skipping a track) you simply hit either volume button.  The first touch of a volume button does not change the volume, but drops down a media control panel.
From here you can pause and go forward or back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting past the pain of catching up all the shows, it should work fine for steady state listening.  Heaven help me if I ever get behind again and just want to catch up.  I’ll be using this for my daily podcasts for a while and see how it goes.
Sure wish I could get my missing podcasts back though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Sacher</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2011-09-07:blog/tech/windows-phone-podcast-experience/</guid><category>windows phone</category><category>podcasts</category></item><item><title>webOS to Windows Phone - What’s Missing?</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/tech/webos-to-windows-phone-whats-missing/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided that I’ll be exploring both Android and Windows Phone as possible replacements for my nearly dead Palm Pre.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; killed future hardware and we need phones, bad.
I purchased an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive off eBay, slightly cheaper than I would get it from Sprint under contract.  I’ve been using it as a WiFi only device for about a week.
Wednesday night, I upgraded it to the developer’s release of Mango, the future update for Windows Phone.  Last night, I added this phone to our third “testing” line on Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will detail the pain points that will exist on doing a webOS to Windows Phone (and specifically the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive) transition.
I will also highlight the cool things I see that aren’t possible on webOS (at least Sprint available webOS phones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="multitasking-vs-multipausing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MultiTasking vs MultiPausing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;webOS is still the best multitasking platform for mobile, full stop.  Windows Phone acts much like iOS, where apps are put into a pause state and resumed when reloaded.
The Arrive has three “soft” buttons on the front for Back, Windows, and Search.  These are needed to navigate and annoying at the same time.
I can’t tell you how often I accidentally tapped search and was bounced into Bing search.  Then a Back tap resumes where you were in a variably amount of time, depending on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the development documentation, there is a term for preparing your application for this pause: “Tombstoning”.
Sit there and act dead and I’ll let you know when you can come out of the coffin.  Mango supposedly has faster resume, but like the iOS transition a short while ago,
the apps must be coded to use this for a faster resume.  Most I’ve used have not been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the back button takes you to a similar view as card mode on webOS.  This isn’t nearly as nice, but I can work with it.  The cards will be a list of the last 5
(or less) apps that you have opened.  You will always start at the right and can swipe to the left in chronological order.  webOS this sure isn’t, but I can deal.
It isn’t as bad as I expected it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notifications"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another feature where webOS tops the mobile space.  Others are getting close, but not there yet.  Windows Phone uses live tiles on the home screen to display some of this information.
However, there is not one place to go to see all that has happened.  I can live with Windows Phone version, but it is vastly inferior.  The unlock screen shows many of the “notifications”,
which is slightly like the locked display on webOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="calendars"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calendars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I purchased our webOS phones, over two years ago, we started expanding into the capabilities of webOS Synergy.  I use a work Exchange calendar, Google personal,
and my wife used two Google calendars for work and personal.  All of these show up on my Pre with no effort other than linking my Google account.  This is not the case with Windows Phone.
It is not even possible to see multiple calendars for one account in the current release of Windows Phone.
When I upgraded to Mango, this was possible, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8000/blog/tech/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/"&gt;only after a hack that I detailed in this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you only have to do this once, I call the Calendar a draw (once Mango comes out, that is.)  webOS has a few nicer features, but Windows Phone is 5x faster in getting through the info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="touchstone"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Touchstone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wireless charging setup for webOS phones and tablets is something that isn’t thought about, until you are plugging cabled into phones for the first time on two years.
I have my Pre sitting right in front of my keyboard on a Touchstone, right now.  When I leave my desk area, I just scoop it up.  It is there to tap songs or quickly look at notifications.
Just a handy setup.  This will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="podcasts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used drPodder for webOS, since early betas.  It is a great app with the ability to download podcasts directly from your phone, or stream them.  It supports audio and video,
as well as some advanced renaming features.  The negatives of using drPodder are all related to the error filled media playing implementation of webOS 1.4.5, where my Pre is stuck.
I just expect the last 6-10 seconds of a podcast to get cut off.  It just happens.  Starting a podcast playing back (even a downloaded one) can take up to 10 seconds.
If my Pre starts getting hot for some reason, playback slows to 80% speed.  But drPodder makes listening to and managing podcasts a breeze.  After playing, the file can be auto deleted.
You can play from bottom or top (oldest to newest or reverse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mango has added podcasts directly into the Zune media system.  I was able to find a majority of the podcasts I listen to in the directory.
I am not used to the immediate response of the software, when lags where just part of the game with webOS.
The current setting is to download audio and video only when WiFi is connected, but this is configurable.
I cannot find a way to manually add an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed to a podcast not in the Zune directory.  So immediately, I’m missing 3 of my normal podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have options of how many of each podcast to download, if you should get oldest or newest first, and if you should play them from oldest or newest.
So it seems to replace most functionality of drPodder.  But not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the podcasts I listen to are nearly 90 minutes.  I almost never listen to them at one sitting.  On webOS, drPodder just keeps my last place and when I start that episode again,
I’m just slightly before when I stopped.  If I leave the podcast in Zune player, and go back to it in the future, I’m right back at the beginning.  This has got to be a joke, right?
They aren’t bookmarking audio podcasts?  It looks like they are handled just like songs.  This is a complete and utter fail and makes audio podcast listening impossible on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for video podcasts, they are storing the position for each one.  I can pause 4 different episodes of a podcast, 3 different ones of another, and all will restore at the correct position.
So I have to download video versions of the podcasts that have them and listen to that on my drive into work, when I will never be looking at the video.
Have I been spoiled too much by drPodder, or is this implementation just not well formed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasting on Windows Phone is a fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="video-playback"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Playback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be it video podcasts or video files that you loaded on the phone via Zune software (which encodes them), they all play great.  However, I have not been able to figure out how to make
sound for Video come out over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; headsets.  Audio works great.  However, once you start a video, it either comes out of the speaker or wired headphones.  I’m not sure if this is an
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive fail or a Windows Phone issue in general.  Why isn’t audio just audio.  Just when I thought that I could used the video versions of a podcast to get past the bookmark issue,
now I can’t use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; headphones for that.  You seriously have to be kidding me.  This is a major annoyance and needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-browser"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to describe the web browser in current Windows Phone, other than crap.  It was really bad.  The Mango update essentially loads &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE9&lt;/span&gt; onto your phone.  While this is still
a step back from the Chrome or Firefox that I’m used to on the desktop, it is a decent mobile browser.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACID3&lt;/span&gt; test jumps from a 12 to a 95, between current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; and Mango.  For most browse
ability, the Windows Phone wins over my old Palm Pre.  This is a combination of screen size and processor speed.  However, there are sites which my Pre can open that Windows Phone Mango
will not.  For getting something done all over the web, webOS still wins here.  For most use, the speed of the newer phone and clean &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; is on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="camera"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Pre3 was released, I think this would be equal or slightly into webOS for functionality.  Video editing on the Pre is pretty cool.  However, my Pre cannot shoot a clear shot closer
than 8 inches.  Scanning barcodes with the phone? Don’t make me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arrive has a 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt; autofocus camera, which allows me to shoot as close as 2-3 cm.  Dedicated camera button that never seems to freeze for up to 20 seconds when I want to load it, as my
aging Pre will do occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also automated uploads to SkyDrive (Microsoft’s cloud storage) if you desire.  This is a hands down win for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive and Windows Phone.  The uploads to Facebook and other
upload features that a almost never using on the Pre are also available here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="apps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Phone Marketplace isn’t iOS or Android level yet, but there are Apps.  More and better games than available for webOS.  The one missing app that I hope they get soon is Pandora.
I have gotten used to listening to a mellow mix over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; headphones while I work.  This will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know one app that is pretty cool?  Netflix.  Streaming on my phone.  Oh, yeah.  These are the things that may push past any of the pain.  The real apps we have been waiting for on webOS
for two years.  While there are some missing innovative apps that are unique to webOS, Windows Phone is walking to the finish line to win on this one.  They have the apps that I hoped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;
scale would bring to webOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bing-search"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bing Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Windows Phone have an app to identify songs?  Yes, but with Mango it is baked into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; itself.  (This is also why Shazam has upped their price to $5.99 for Windows Phone, as
they will be obsolete when the Mango update pushes out.)  To search for music in Mango, tap the search button and tap the music icon at the bottom.  Then let the phone listen.
It does a decent job identifying music, with a link to the Zune marketplace if you want to purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have visual search, that allows you to photograph text with the camera and translate it into other languages, or pull up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QR&lt;/span&gt; code, Microsoft Tags, UPCs for books, CDs, DVDs.
It isn’t perfect with the text, but better than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have voice search.  This works amazingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="speech-to-text-and-text-to-speech"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speech to Text and Text to Speech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in trying this out on Android, as Molly Wood indicated that she uses it in more places than just searching.  However, I found it very useful.  If you hold down the windows key,
you activate voice mode.  I may say: “text Amy”, it will respond with which of my wife’s numbers I should text.  I say “Google” for her Google Voice number.  It then says “Texting Amy Sacher”
and goes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; composition mode.  Then I say what I want to text.  It gets it down fairly accurately and reads it back to me.  I can say “Send”, “Try Again”, or “Cancel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Open” followed by any installed app name works to start up that app.  “Call” followed by a phone number works as long as you say each digit and don’t call 18 “eighteen” instead of “one, eight”.
If it doesn’t recognize a valid verb noun combo, it will bing search for the text you spoke.  This blows away the functionality that I’ve played with on the Pre2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="trial-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trial Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone apps allow trial versions.  This would be fairly simple to hack around in webOS and is possible, because the apps are compiled.
I have tried many apps and it keeps be from buying bad apps, which is have done many times on webOS.  This is good for keeping the collection of apps strong.
If you try 3 apps to provide one service, download all the trials.  Then buy the one you like, but review all three.  This will reward good developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m downloading all the trials of Instapaper apps right now.  Let the best app win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tethering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tethering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the features that I use on my webOS phone, tethering for free on Sprint is the most needed, due to now having the Touchpad.  This is easy on both webOS and Android.
I’m not sure if this is possible with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive and Windows Mobile, yet.  I believe some type of tethering will be available with Mango, but if you can do it without the extra
fee is yet to be seen.  This may be the deal breaker that takes me to Android.  But comparing webOS to Windows Phone, webOS knocks it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="homebrew"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no debate on this one.  webOS homebrew is the only thing that kept people on webOS in the dark days (1) before &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; acquisition.  It is also how people are staying on webOS with
FrankenPre2s and other methods of staying on their carrier and getting through the dark days (2) after the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; cancellation.  There is not a more open system than webOS, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-files-on-device"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Files on Device&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; mode for Windows Phone.  Like iTunes on iOS, you go through Zune.  This is annoying.  The only other real option is going through SkyDrive.
This worked to edit an Office document on the phone from SkyDrive and push it back up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With webOS stock, you can connect your phone to your computer as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive.  Copy either way.  All good.  With a little WebOSInternals, you can &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; into the phone and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt; files with the
phone just being on the same network.  This is an easy webOS win and I have many “work arounds” to learn if I will be staying on Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="development"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this doesn’t affect strictly users, I see the development environment for each platform pretty well matched.  There are cool things that webOS does where Windows Phone can’t match,
and vice versa.  We are still waiting for mic access and other hardware access on webOS.  Both platforms are much nicer than trying to develop for Android.  I’m looking into MonoGame to port
apps to Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, and possibly webOS, in addition to the native support on Windows Phone, Windows, and XBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a fun little scripting app on the phone called TouchDevelop.  This exposes most if not all the phone’s capabilities for your little mini programs.  I made a 4 line program
that prompted me to talk, converted Speech to Text, then used Text to Speech to read it back to me.  I’m sure I’ll mes with this more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part that I will have trouble working past is if I can’t get tethering on my Windows Phone.   I will be getting an Android phone via our two year upgrade discount, to test that
platform as well (most likely a Nexus S).  No conclusions what platform I’m landing on yet, still much more research to be done.  Unlike webOS, the hardware is solid.
Performance of individual apps blow away my aging webOS hardware.  However, there are software fixes that are still needed.  Since Mango will not hit for a month or more, these will be a
while in coming.’, ‘webOS to Windows Phone: What’s Missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joe Sacher</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2011-09-02:blog/tech/webos-to-windows-phone-whats-missing/</guid><category>webos</category><category>windows phone</category></item><item><title>Multiple Google Calendars on Windows Phone (Mango)</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/tech/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With webOS, Synergy just happened.  (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it didn’t just happen.  Many engineers spent many hours making this work seamlessly.  But to the user, it “just happened”.)  You don’t realize how nice this is, until you try a system that doesn’t really have it.  Windows Phone 7 with NoDo (the current “up to date” version for the public) has this problem.  The update due out September or October called Mango (or Windows phone 7.5) enables more Synergy like features, such as multiple calendars.  However, Google doesn’t allow you to select more than one.  But there’s a hack for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most Windows Phone 7 users who are waiting for the Mango release, this won’t be useful yet.  But you can go through the steps if you want, and it will magically show all your Google calendars when you get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is only selecting the primary calendar to sync to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP7&lt;/span&gt; calendar.   In my situation, I have an Exchange Work calendar and a Google Personal calendar.  Both of those showed up with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP7&lt;/span&gt; NoDo.  What was missing is my wife’s Google Work and Personal calendars.  Here is how I enabled them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google will allow you to configure the calendar to sync if it believes you are an iOS device.  If you have access to an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, etc.) you can use those to do this.  Otherwise, we will just fake it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fake an iPhone, I used Google Chrome.  You will want to start up the browser on the command line.  So open up a Command Shell and “cd” (change directory) into the proper directory for chrome.exe.  If you don’t know where this is, right-click on the shortcut in Windows and select Properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to close down any Chrome browsers you may have open before you do this.  We will paste the following into your command prompt to start Chrome as an iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;chrome.exe --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_0 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Mobile/8A293 Safari/6531.22.7"
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/GC_Inital.png" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Browse to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://m.google.com/sync"&gt;http://m.google.com/sync&lt;/a&gt;.  You should see something similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/GC_UnChecked.png" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Click on WindowsPhone and you will see your calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="legend"&gt;
Notice only your main calendar is checked.  No problem, check the others.  But that doesn’t work.  Google has blocked this with JavaScript.  We just need to turn JavaScript off.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 462px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/GC_Javascript.png" style="width: 462px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Click on the wrench icon at the top right of Chrome and select Options.  Now click Under the Hood on the left.  Click the Content Settings button.  Change JavaScript section to not allow any site to run JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/GC_Checked.png" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Now you will be able to select the other calendars and click Save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="legend"&gt;
Going back to your Mango phone, you should be able to sync and see all calendars.  Just remember to reselect JavaScript.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The too long didn’t read version of this post is this: Download HandBrake, render using the iPad Preset and change frame rate to Same as Source.  Upload to Touchpad and be happy.  If you care about some of the testing I did, continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a high end &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; video file, to take advantage of the full resolution of the Touchpad.  The video I played with is a BluRay version of Pixar’s Partly Cloudy.  This is a 1080p video (1920x1080), with 5.1 channel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC3&lt;/span&gt; sound (48 kHz and 16 bit).  This is most likely the highest video quality source that people will use for Touchpad encoding.  Runtime is 5:48 with 23.976 frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two pieces of software I used are Format Factory (now a dead link) and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/"&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; (Windows, Mac, Linux. Tested on the Windows version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First render was in Format Factory with the iPad setting at 720x480 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPEG4&lt;/span&gt;.  This rendered slightly faster than I had been seeing with HandBrake.  There is a noticeable quality loss with stretching the 720 out to the Touchpad’s 1024 width, but the video is very watchable.  If you did not have a 1024 width video to compare it to, you would not see an issue.  File Size 47.0 Mb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the same iPad setting and bumped the resolution to 1024x768, keeping all the other settings the same.  What surprised me is the file size dropped to 46.6 Mb.  Looking closer, I noticed that the video bit rate is fixed at 1000 kbs, rather than using HandBrake’s quality style setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HandBrake has a video format for the iPad at 1024 width with aspect ratio set height (but steps width down to source video width if smaller than 1024).  The only change I made before I ran this encoding was to set frame rate as Same as Source.  (It was defaulted to 29.97.)  The encoding takes longer than Format Factory (1.1-1.4x).  The file size came out to 69.8 Mb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at both 1024 wide videos on the Touchpad, you can see the difference between Format Factory’s 1120 kbs data rate and HandBrake’s 1672 kbs data rate.  There was quite a bit of motion blocking artifacts with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FF&lt;/span&gt;’s encode.  The added time to render due to detecting quality of the frame dynamically is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upped the Format Factory setting to use 1500 kbs video data rate (for similar to HandBrake’s total data rate) to do an apples to apples comparison.  File size came out to 67.9 Mb, so pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the two on the Touchpad, they are very hard to tell apart most of the time.  The biggest issues is with horizontal streaking on single color backgrounds for the Format Factory version.  By going with a fixed bit rate, rather than the HandBrake’s quality based setting, you also get blocking during highly changing scenes.  HandBrake will use less data during the static scenes, but more during dynamic scenes, resulting in a better encoding at the same overall file size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rendered some of the files that I have ripped from my DVDs (most 640 x proper aspect ratio height) through HandBrake, using the iPad profile.  These play great.  The Touchpad had no issues with m4v or mp4 file extension for the H.264 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPEG&lt;/span&gt; 4 files these apps were generating. It will not display the Xvid based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPEG4&lt;/span&gt; files that I have encoded for use with my media players and Boxee Box before H.264 was the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching video on the Touchpad just reminds you how great the audio on this thing sounds.  Really a good video viewing experience.  Do some transcoding and enjoy your moving picture shows.&lt;/p&gt;

The password field for the WiFi key is frustrating.
The last character is only shown for a second or two, then it too fades into the dots of obscurity.  This is fine in normal use with passwords you are used to typing, but a WiFi key is complex and entered only once per new device.
When you add to this a finiky WiFi network acceptance, you have time after time frustration.  The key is entered and network selected (even with a check mark!), but for some reason the Touchpad won’t accept anything but Cancel.
Guess who gets to type the key in again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out how to view a key as I enter it and validate the key, so I can be sure the passcode part of the network acceptance is valid.  If I had done this the first time I started to enter our complex key, I would have only had to type it once and been able to verify it easily.  Typing 64 characters with only vision on the last one is a little too tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLEASE&lt;/span&gt; make an option to show the passcode.  All you have to do is change the enyo options of the text box.  Entering a passcode for WiFi should not be this hard.  If it must be secure by default, put a check box that allows “Show Passcode”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my work around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 444px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/01-Join-Network.png" style="width: 444px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;When you have the WiFi network selection open, tap on the “+ Join Network”.  The image was captured before the Touchpad located any WiFi networks.  Normally, you will see your network and possibly others above the “+ Join Network” option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/02-Join-Network-Open.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;This will open a dialog that is normally used for you to enter the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSID&lt;/span&gt; of a hidden WiFi network.  Instead, we are typing our WiFi passcode in plain text (oh, glorious plain text).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/03-Type-and-Select-All.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;You can now see all characters and scroll back and forth to verify everything is correct (just tap and drag to the left or right.)  When it looks good, tap and hold to bring up the Select menu.  Choose Select All.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/05-Hold-for-Copy.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Now with everything selected, tap and hold again for the Copy menu.  Select Copy and you have your WiFi key in your clipboard.  Tap cancel and select your WiFi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/06-Hold-for-Paste.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Tap and hold in the passcode field and you can select Paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Warning: An Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids. Yes, it sounds weird. I don’t understand how they made it through marketing. I don’t think they had any type of focus group for these. I have a rule that I will try anything once, as long as there isn’t a high likelihood of death. I think this is why blowfish is so expensive, for the malpractice insurance for those that die after eating it. I don’t plan on trying blowfish any time soon. But I’m game for Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me see if I can take you through it. You pop this mint in your mouth pretty quick. See this isn’t an M&amp;amp;M. it will melt in your hand. So you have to pop it in quick.  And if you wait too long, you might just lose your nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first flavor that you get is dark chocolate. Some people like dark chocolate, but I prefer milk chocolate. So I’m dealing with the chocolate when the other flavors start. Imagine that your are eating the most over-spiced pumpkin pie that you have ever tasted… but it is covered in dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was mildly strange. After some time, the chocolate has been sucked off and you are just sucking on a piece of pumpkin pie. Well sort of. But you have been desensitized to the spice, so it seems a little like pumpkin pie. But something is hiding there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat starts to pour in. It makes sense. I had forgotten that these were Altoids. And they are curiously strong. I should have expected this. So the heat is building and I feel like I am eating a super hot radish. That is covered in ginger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after you have had an Altoids, your breath is usually fresh. It has to be, because you have burned off a the top four layers of skin in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is different. My breath smells worse. It is actually making me gag. A breath mint shouldn’t make your breath worse. My breath is like I left a pumkin pie in a hot car all day. A really old car. With a gym bag. Really bad breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it should have been a clue when Julie put out the Altoids tin. She said that she tried a few and wasn’t sure about how they taste. They are now available for others to sample. I should have seen something there, because you protect the Altoids. You make sure that no one is around and sneak one out quick and then hide it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, if you are offered a Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids, try one. It is an experience. Maybe not a good one, but good lives are chains of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please get a real mint before you come around me to breathe all your pumpkin pie breath on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The ring on her finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 24th, 2004, I met Amy for the first time on our date at Acapulco Joe’s in Downtown Indianapolis. Amy’s car broke down just before we met, so she was driving her dad’s old Ford Ranger. We have been seeing each other since. On Feb 26th, we were going to reach an obscure and geeky anniversary. We will have known each other for exactly 30,000 hours. About two months ago, I targeted this date for something I had been planning for almost a year. She said, “Yes.” I’m now engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I’ve been very careful with how I didn’t give away surprises, while knowing I was giving them away. I knew I would need Amy to know my “tell”. The latest was my response to her asking if I had her favorite pizza place make a heart shaped pizza for Valentine’s Day. This was after I told her a food place was going to make dinner in a way they didn’t think about till I asked if they could. I kind of looked away and gave her a “no comment”, when she asked if I was having a pizza made in a heart. When the heart shaped pizza showed up, she already knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told Amy to reserve February 26th as a date night, she didn’t think anything of it. She didn’t know of any special date or anniversary for the 26th. Amy immediately tried to figure out what we were doing, but I gave no clues. After many days, she came across the idea of going out for a play or a movie. Here my months of “giving away” my secret plans had come into play. I “gave away” that I had no comment about that. Amy bought it hook, line and sinker. Now, I just had many things to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important piece was getting insurance for and picking up the ring. Without that, nothing happens. Since I work at an insurance company, I consulted some co-workers for best ideas about getting coverage for this ring. It wasn’t a cheap ring and would really hurt to lose it, damage it, have it stolen, etc. With all of those details taken care of, I picked up the ring in early February. I had to bring it to work on the day I picked it up, because of the way the timing worked out. I told the co-worker who helped with insurance advice that I had picked it up. She asked to see it. I said, “No. Men have died for less than showing someone an engagement before she gets it.” After thinking about it, she agreed. When I got home, I had to find a good hiding place. Just knowing that the ring was sitting there and I couldn’t say anything was tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started preparations and tried to keep them secret. I was on a time crunch for making the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; and would up letting Amy know about it, just playing it off as a fun scavenger hunt to start the date. I didn’t finish it until the night before the “date.” It was really dorky, but I thought she would get a kick out if it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole night was almost blown as we left work, a day before the big event. A co-worker who knew about my plans yelled, “Good Luck Joe!” I reacted with a quieter, “Its not tonight.” Then I shut up and hoped Amy didn’t hear anything. I learned later that she did, just didn’t think it was for anything special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day was here and I gave Amy a note at 5:20, then left in her truck. It isn’t running very well and took some will power to get to the destination. She now drives a Passat and I use the truck when we need to haul things a short distance. The front of the note indicated that it shouldn’t be opened till 5:30. Then the note told Amy to get in my car (which I left in the driveway) and start it at exactly 5:40. By that time, I was almost to the restaurant. The parking spot I was looking for and hoping to be empty was empty. It is an important spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amy Cox, this is your mission should you chose to accept it.” That audio greeted Amy as she started the car. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; consisted of me being a dork and Mission Impossible music, with directions. At a few places where the timing was unknown, I had her skip to the next track once she reached various places. I figured that she would know where she was heading about half way there. It didn’t really matter if she found out. I had more planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thought about standing outside, right were I was waiting for her on our first date. I decided not to for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She would wonder why and possibly think it was a really special day (we couldn’t have that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COLD&lt;/span&gt;. I was willing to do it if I had not thought of #1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy arrived a little after 6 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. I was sitting in the same booth we sat on our first date. This wasn’t an accident. I had come previously and made sure to have it reserved. However, I had done this once before on the anniversary of our first date, so nothing to shockingly new yet. After all, this was the 26th, not the 24th, and February, not September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner was nice. We chatted and Amy couldn’t figure out something special was going on. All according to plan. After dinner we ordered dessert. We had never eaten dessert at Acapulco Joe’s. Cheesecake was odd for a Mexican Restaurant, but the fried ice-cream felt at home. Amy took the cherry, but gave me the stem. I like seeing how fast I can tie them into a knot with my tongue. When we left the table, I slipped the tied stem into my pocket for something cheesy later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During dinner, Amy asked what I had to haul in the truck, because that was the reason I told her I was taking it. I wouldn’t tell. She worried that it was sitting in the back of the truck to be stolen. I told her that it fit in the cab. This made her ask why I didn’t just take the car. To that I said nothing and changed the subject. I couldn’t tell her that the cargo I was carrying in the truck was the most expensive thing that truck has ever carried. It wasn’t sitting in the truck, it was in my coat pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left at 6:54 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. I told Amy that the rest of the night required the truck and we walked towards it. While crossing the street Amy mentioned, “Its funny. I drove the truck here on our first date and you drove the Maxima.” I resisted the urge to reply quickly and acted out my best thinking look for 10 seconds. Then I replied, “I guess so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked up the sidewalk towards the truck. When she spotted it, she said “That is about were I parked, too.” It was actually exactly where she parked. The last spot before the hydrant. “Really?” was all I said. I told her she needed to get in the truck, but she couldn’t find her keys in her purse. I opened the door for her. As she started to get in the truck I told her to turn around. I got down on one knee and said some of the things that I had written down throughout the week. I was nervous and don’t remember exactly what I said. The only part that I can really remember is that it was exactly 30,000 hours since we first met and I’ve loved spending a majority of those hours since then with her. I should have had the camera ready to capture her face when she realized what was going on. I placed the ring on her finger and she just stared at it. I let her enjoy it for a while before reaching in my pocket to get something to put in the box. Then I gave her the closed box and told her that wasn’t all. She opened the box and I said, “Here is the knot I tied on the night I asked you to tie the knot.” Cheezy, but she laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that she thought we were going to see a movie or play tonight, so I gave her the option of going to see a movie. She said that she didn’t know, but that sounded good. As we were walking to the truck, Amy had mentioned how cold it was. I offered to drive her back to the car in the truck. She mentioned that she didn’t feel cold any more. I just walked her back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were to meet up just south of 465, then get in the car for the rest of the way. When I almost got there, my cell phone rang. It was Amy. She called her mom on the way home and was on auto pilot. She was almost home, instead of heading to where we were supposed to meet. I’m guessing shock was involved. She told me that she probably couldn’t stay still for a movie and wanted to tell everyone. I thought that would be the case, but she told me she wanted to go. I started driving back to her house. Amy spent the rest of the night and all day at work showing everyone her ring. I was glad that I was finally out of the “When you giving her a ring?” question. I didn’t know that it was immediately replaced with another question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You two set a date yet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: We were married on June 6th, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

I could not find many that had used both, to get an idea of the differences between them. Now owning a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; Turncrafter Pro and having taken a class and used a Jet Mini for 5 hours or so, I decided to summarize the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both lathes look deceptively similar. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; is 4” longer in the bed at 18”, vs 14” for the Jet. The Jet also has one higher speed. The first 5 speed ranges seem to be very close. The beds look almost exactly the same, as do the banjo and steady rest. The motor height adjustment is almost exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality wise, the Jet has a nicer finish and features. By this, I mean the machining is a little better cleaned up and parts are more thought out. The threads on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; headstock looked like there were cut and never touched again. There are burrs and sharp edges that I will be dressing down. While the Jet lathe I was using had been in use at the classroom for a while, I haven”t noticed this on Jet minis out on display at shops either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major difference, which will affect daily use, are the belt access doors. The Jet has a nice flip open door for both top and bottom access. Although the spring handle setup for the bottom door seems a little strange to me, it works fast once you get used to it. The access to the belts are in exactly the same spot, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; has a thumb screw to undo and then a little plastic piece which is lifted and removed. This piece has slits on the bottom that sits on bolts screwed in below the opening. The piece would be set down for the change then replaced. It makes for a piece to lose and takes over twice as long to change the belt speed as on the Jet. I will be replacing my plastic pieces with doors that have a spring clip, similar to the Jet’s. Currently my access panels are off, because they are annoying to remove and replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locking handle on the steady rest and the tail stock depth lock are both a plastic handles on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;. The operation is the same, both spring loaded handles which can be lifted to change position. The plastic handles don’t feel flimsy, but I doubt they will last quite as long as the metal handles on the Jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point to point, my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; is slightly off (1/32” tail is closer to me than the head point).  While a thin shim under the tail will fix this, I”m not sure if this is typical with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; or not. My sample size is 1. I did not see this with the 4 Jet lathes I looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still happy with my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; purchase. After I spend a little bit of time to polish off some of the rough edges and I will have a nice lathe for about $100 less than the Jet. I don’t see the loss of the high end (3800 rpm or so) on the Jet as too much of a problem. 3200 rpm is fast enough and both have the 500 rpm low end. But there is no doubt, the Jet is a better finished machine, with a few upgrades over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;. If I could have found the Jet on special for within $20-40 of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;, I would have paid the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/loadedrocket.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;I’ll be describing the construction of the gray panniers located directly under my seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find a pannier set that works exactly as I would like for the under-seat rack on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.   I like the panniers made by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.panniers.com"&gt;Arkel&lt;/a&gt; of all the panniers I have looked at and used.  However, it was impossible to find a size that worked exactly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make my own set tailored (quite literally) exactly to my needs and I borrowed quite a bit from Arkel’s design work.  Below is a description of the process for those who would like to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bicycle panniers are designed for normal upright bicycles.  Good panniers have been designed to never contact the rider’s feet.  At the very least this interference would be annoying.  At the worst, it could cause an accident.  It is very important to check clearance in all odd positions you can encounter on your bicycle, as frame locations and distances vary with every bicycle.  Does a fully turned front fork with the foot forward catch, etc.  Since I am designing a bag for use under my seat on a recumbent, foot strike issues are not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/WholeSetup.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dining room table pannier production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first debated tapering the bottom of the bag.  I couldn’t come up with a reason to do that.  My previous panniers for the under-seat rack were Arkel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;-30’s.  These are normally used as front panniers and are tall and skinny.  My biggest problem with using them on the under-seat rack is the occasional dragging while turning at faster speeds (i.e. using more lean).  I also wanted quite a bit more storage under the seat, to get as much weight low and forward as possible.  A rectangular design will be the absolute easiest shape I can build.  It also will be an efficient use of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lessons Learned: It might have been a little better to design the bag such that the bottom is level with the ground in the riding position.  Notice in the first picture above that the portion of the pannier towards the rear is lower than the front.  If I gave the pannier a little more height in the front and less in the back, I would have a slightly more optimized design for this cycle, without the bag ground strike issues I will talk about later in this article.  Keep factors like that in mind as you design your custom bag.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mocked up a pannier using a corrugated plastic back plate and paper, to check the size and clearance when the bike was leaned over to 45 degrees.  I should never get that far over while turning, but it gives me a decent safety factor.  I decided on a size of 18” long, 12.25” tall, and ~6” deep.  The zipper sections have the most seams and allowances, so I wasn’t sure what the exact final depth would be.  I planned on using a 1/2” allowance seams for everything, except for the specialized seams on the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how much time I saved by spending the hour making the mock up. It does wonders in increase your confidence about actually creating this thing.  I was able to finalize mounting hardware location as well, eliminating putting holes through the fabric in the wrong place with the final bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lessons Learned: Again on the issue of ground strike.  When measuring that 45 degree clearance, give a generous 3-4” buffer from the ground.  This is to take into account that the bag &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; sag under weight and more than you think.  Well at least more than I thought, but you might be smarter than me.  (Hopefully you are after reading this!)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="construction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased most of my raw materials from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.therainshed.com/"&gt;The Rain Shed&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good source for outdoor patterns and fabrics.  I would recommend anyone starting out making outdoor equipment to pick up Sew and Repair Your Outdoor Gear by Louise Lindgren.  I ordered it along with my fabric from the Rain Shed and it was easily worth the $17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/HeatSeal.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Using a cheap soldering iron to melt the threads together at the edge where the fabric was cut, to prevent unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using a 1000 Denier Cordura for the main fabric of the pannier.  The Cordura I used is the gray fabric in the pictures.   I need 4 pieces of fabric for the main body of the pannier:  The front of the pannier (which I define as the side facing away from the bike), the back and bottom, and the two pieces that make up the sides and top.  Both of the side and top pieces run parallel with each other, with a zipper in between them.  All this should make more sense as you start to see pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with the side/top pieces, because they would take up most of the width of the fabric.  I wanted the strength of the fabric (the warp) to be along the short dimension of the pieces, so they have to be cut with the long axis parallel to the weft.  (Warp are the threads running the length of the fabric, Weft are those running “back and forth”.)    The dimensions for my two side pieces are 7.5” x 44” and 1.5” x 44”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 325px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SmallSideZipper.jpg" style="width: 325px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side zipper seams from the outside, indicated in red.  Notice first seam is inside the fold and second seam secures the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that the most important things to do with synthetics after cutting is heat sealing.    You don’t want you bags to unravel during use and scatter all of my contents across the road!  For most thin synthetics, you can use a good hot knife for both cutting and sealing.  While I’ve used a hot knife for thin nylon, I would guess that it would be hard to cut fabric this thick  without leaving a large hard edge of melted nylon.  I used a cheap soldering iron for sealing the edges of the Cordura, after cutting out with very sharp sewing scissors.  This didn’t leave hard edges, but secured the fibers well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYK&lt;/span&gt; size 10 coil zipper for the pannier.  The size 10 is about the largest you can get and should wear very well.  The coil zipper will run around the curves of the pannier much better than a toothed zipper and the strengths are about equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 333px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SmallSideZipperBack.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side zipper seams from the inside, indicated in red.  Notice the fabric just sticking out past teh zipper from the first seam, before the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the small side piece.  The first seam is stitched with the wrong side of the zipper and fabric out.  I used a zipper foot to stitch along the zipper, leaving enough room for the large sliders.  After the first seam was finished, I pulled the fabric back, so the right side was facing up and stitched the second seam using the regular foot against the zipper (the spacing worked out just right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the pictures, you can see the two seams indicated with red lines.  The first image is from the right side of the zipper and the second from the wrong side.  Just above the red lines in the wrong side picture, you can see a little of the folded over fabric sticking out.  I tried to line up the edges of the zipper and fabric for the first seam.  This wandered just a little on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 152px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SeamRipReflector.jpg" style="width: 152px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Seam ripping the reflector off, because I sewed it on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the seams in the pannier I used a nylon thread.  From what I have read, cotton can rot and the nylon fibers of the Cordura will cut polyester.  I used heavy duty nylon thread through out the pannier construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 285px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SideReflector.jpg" style="width: 285px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side reflective tape combo picture, low light without flash fading into flash picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step for the larger side piece is sewing on the reflector strips, made from 3M reflective fabric tape.  I located them so they would be halfway up the side.  Also, don’t get distracted and sew the reflector on the wrong side.  Surely no one would be that stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was concerned about the exposed edge of the reflective tape at first. After sewing a piece to a scrap of fabric and scratching over it for quite a while with my fingernails, I was unable to get the tape to unravel any significant amount.  I think it should hold up fine without rolling over the top edges.  Any time the ends of the tape are exposed, however, they need to be folded under before being sewn.  For these side pieces, both edges will be covered by edging on one side and a seam to the back on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SidePieces.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Both piece of the side/top of the pannier.  These will run 3/4 of the way around the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a laugh out of the shot with the flash was on.  The reflective tape seems to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left you can see the two side pieces.  The smaller piece is finished, except for being joined to the front panel.  While it looks like it curves, this is only because of the zipper seam pulled that edge of the zipper together, making it shorter.  This will go away after you sew along the other side of the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 286px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSideWide.jpg" style="width: 286px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side parts showing edge detail for front and rear reflectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger piece has both piece of reflector tape sewn in place (on the correct side!).  One edge of the larger side piece will be exposed, because it is acts as a flap for the zipper.  I used 3/4” cross-grain nylon ribbon to treat the edge.  This looks much nicer than a raw edge and should also keep it from unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 144px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SecondZipperStitch.jpg" style="width: 144px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Both stitches on the large side piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it easier to sew this edge when I folded the tape and ironed it, before sewing.  By “I found it easier”, I mean by not ironing the ribbon in half, it is close to impossible to sew it nicely.  With it ironed, it is just really difficult.  I pined it in place every 6 inches or so, as I sewed the edge.  You can’t pin too far ahead, because the tape adjusts length a little as you sew.  This edge will also contain one of the exposed reflective tape ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSide.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Finished side pieces, zipped together.  The left side with the flap laying down as it will normally be to protect the zipper from debris and water.  The right side has the flap lifted to show the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish the large side piece, I ran a second stitch along the zipper.  I again used the zipper foot for one and regular foot for the other, to maintain consistent spacing.  I then installed the two zipper pulls.  When the pannier is closed, the two pulls will be together.  It will open like a back pack, with the two zippers pulling away from each other to make an opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is cutting out the front panel and joining it to the smaller of the side pieces.  The dimensions for the front panel are 19” x 13.25” (18” x 12.25” finished).   Again, you want to cut out the shorter dimension along the weft of the fabric, allowing the stronger warp threads to be vertical in the pannier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedFront.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front sewn to small side piece and zipper half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the piece is cut out and heat sealed, you join it to the shorter side piece on three edges, leaving one of the longer edges exposed to join with the back/bottom piece.  I lined up the pieces at the tip center, but sewed to as one long seam with two turns.  See the image of the finished side and front joined together.  All that is left is to sew in the back panel pouch, join the back on, cut the back panel, bent and install the aluminum support, and install the mounting hardware.  In other words, we aren’t even half way there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 400px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedFrontAndSide.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front and Side zipped together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add a mesh pocket for holding things I need while riding and drying wet stuff.  I could have done this along with the side seams to the front, but I wanted a smaller pocket.  I also wanted the bottom of this pocket to be a few inches above the bottom of the pannier to keep it from sagging down and possibly dragging in turns.  Both of these made sewing the pocket on a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSideWithPulls.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Details of the dual zipper pulls, prior to joining the short side to the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister came over and got excited about the project.  Ruth is more experienced at sewing than I am, but this the first “industrial” sewing project for either of us.   She helped me figure out how to attach the mesh pocket.   I used elastic across the top, folded over and stitched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 426px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/PinningMeshPocket.jpg" style="width: 426px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pinning the mesh pocket onto the outside prior to sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sewed on the pocket with the same cross-grain ribbon I used on the zipper cover and mitered edges at the corner.  There were a few places that… umm… missed the tape.  But she re-did those.  I’m going for functionality, not beauty. Beauty wouldn’t be bad though.  I can’t say much, because she actually sewed them on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, I was fairly tough with the low power of my machine.  If I keep up this type of work, I’ll want to pick up a lightweight industrial machine.  A machine that sews straight with plenty of power is the best option.  We didn’t pull the elastic along the top enough with the first piece.  Sewing down elastic takes out some of the retracting capability.  One pocket will be slightly more loose than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other lesson learned is that it would have been easier to sew on the pocket before sewing the front to the sides.  On my second bag, I sewed the netting along with the front and side/top seams.  It turned out cleaner and was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUCH&lt;/span&gt; easier.  It also yields a larger pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One negative of this is the it sticks out a little more and can get damaged easier.  I have a small tear in mine from a slight drag with a little too much weight in the mesh pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SupportHolder.jpg" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Internal pocket on the back side to hold the stiffener board.  Where the black nylon ends at the bottom is the transition from back to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut back/bottom piece at 19” x 21” (finished 18” x 12.25” back and 18” x 7.75” bottom.)  Again, this was heat sealed all around the edge.  The warp ran along the 21” direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before sewing onto the sides/top, I wanted to put in a pocked for the stiffener.  This was cut from lightweight black nylon and sealed, 19” x 13”.  The sides of the pocket will be sewn into the seams.  I rolled over and hemmed the top to get a clean edge.  I rolled over the bottom before sewing to the Cordura.  The top remains open to load in the support panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done much sewing, you know there is that one time when everything is going right.  You have been fighting seams all day and this seam is the best one so far.  It is straight and the fabric is laying perfectly.  That only means one thing, you bobbin just ran out of thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 186px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/EmptyBobbin.jpg" style="width: 186px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sew all you want, but when the thread runs out in the bobbin you are just punching holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sides of the back/bottom piece are sewn to the exposed edges of the front/sides/top piece.  I centered the sides/top piece along the top of the back/bottom piece and sewed that first.  This distributed the sides evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all simple seams of keeping the fabric aligned and sewing at the right offset.  However, because of all the hardware on the individual pieces, it takes some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 323px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedPannier.jpg" style="width: 323px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pannier with sewing finished, before support hardware was added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the side pocket, you can see a small strip of reflective tape.  Were I smart about it, I would have sewn this reflector along the entire edge of the front piece and into the seam at the side.  This would be a larger reflecting surface and eliminate the need to fold over the ends of the tape to sew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 234px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/PlasticSupport.jpg" style="width: 234px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;1/8” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDPE&lt;/span&gt; plastic sheet for hook support mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attentive reader might also have figured out that these pannier could be made with a single piece for the back, bottom, and front.  I had thought of this at first, but decided the likely hood of me lining everything up correctly with essentially two “U” shaped pieces of fabric (with the sides/top and the back/bottom/front) might be zero.  My main concern was the unknown zipper seam offset.  This would vary the thickness and make the bottom piece width vary.  However, if you sewed together the side/top pieces and them measured the finished width, you could easily create a one piece back/bottom/front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.arkel-od.com/en/bicycle-accessories.html"&gt;hook kit from Arkel&lt;/a&gt; for mounting the panniers to the bike.   This consists of two hooks up top, with a cam locking mechanism that locks the hooks onto the rack rail.  Then an elastic hook holds onto the bottom of the rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of this mounting method requires support inside the pannier.  My dad had a piece of 1/8” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDPE&lt;/span&gt; plastic that would work.  I used some cardboard to prototype the support size before cutting plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/OnBike.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Test fit in location on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scored the plastic with a razer knife and then folded it over to break the edge, similar to cutting drywall.   I used a jigsaw to round over the corners of the sheet, then I cleaned up the edges with sand paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 315px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/RoundingCorners.jpg" style="width: 315px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rounding the corners with a jigsaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounting requires two holes in the support panel.  I locked the clips on the rack and positioned the bag where I wanted it to mark the hole positions.  I used the soldering iron to melt through the back fabric and into the plastic, then drilled holes in the support.  Last, I melted the hole in the back fabric to match the size of the drilled hole.  I was careful to not melt into the nylon pocket material.  After I tightened the nylock nuts for the hooks, I made sure to clean off any edges that might cut in the pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last design element I borrowed from Arkel is the support rod.  This takes the force from the front of the pannier and distributes it to the back, where the hooks transfer the load to the bike.  If this rod was not installed, the weight in the pannier would allow the outside edge of the bottom to drop until the contents stopped compressing and the top and front took up the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 337px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SupportRod.jpg" style="width: 337px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Support rod bent from 1/4” solid 6061 aluminum.  It is important to keep the edges that meet the top of the pannier well radiused to spread the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rod is 1/4” 6061 solid aluminum rod.  We started bending at one edge.  First the piece that will go into the webbing pocket, next the section goes along the side, then the portion along the top, next the other side, finally the webbing pocket piece on the far side.  The side edge length isn’t critical, as long as they are equal.  They should be as long as possible, however, because that will reduce the angle it makes with the back.  The greater this angle becomes, the more force is pushed into the bike, rather than just down on the hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 473px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/TopRodHolder.jpg" style="width: 473px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Top rod holder sewed to the top/side.  It is mounted back enough that the force in not on the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sewed in the top rod holder first.  This is the most critical one for positioning.  For material, I use a light weight 200 Cordura, which I had on hand.  It doesn’t match, but no one ever sees it.  After cutting the piece, I rolled over and stitched the shorter edges before sewing it into place.  Care should be taken to get this as parallel as possible with the back edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that when the piece is pulled out firmly, it does not reach the zipper.  If it does, extra force will be focused directly on the zipper.  I’ve talked with zippers quite a bit, they don’t like this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 355px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SideRodHolder.jpg" style="width: 355px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;One side rod holder located at the bottom back. The other side is the same, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom holder consists of 3/4” nylon webbing, which is folded over and stitched along the edge to form a pocket.  You don’t have to get the exact length right, but you want to get the fold correct.  Once you sew this portion, you can cut the overall length to leave just a small margin to sew it to the bag.  To find the position for these, install the rod inside the top holder and mount the pannier on the bike.  Fake some force in the pannier top and figure out where it needs to me positioned to get the top level with some force on it.  If you didn’t get the two sides equal when bending the rod, here is where you correct any small problems.  Just make sure to mark the rod so it goes in the same way each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my bag is much wider than the pannier I modeled this after, I wanted to beef up the support.   I cut and added the 45 degree webbing reinforcement when I sewed the pocket.   With that, I was done.   I put it on the bike and loaded it down to ride for a few days.  I was worried that I would have to tie directly to the plastic sheet, but even after touring for months the attachment I used was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my 70+ days on the bike, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8000/category/trans-am.html"&gt;during my Trans-Am tour&lt;/a&gt;, I learned a few things.  The overall design and construction was sound.  The bags are pretty decent at shedding water and held up pretty well to carrying the bulk of my touring load.  A few things didn’t work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I under estimated the tilt angle that I might need to make on the bike, after the bags sagged slightly with heavy load.  I would use 60 degrees as a measure next time, instead of 45 degrees.   Obviously, if you make them shallower, this becomes less of a factor as well.  This was augmented by the second problem, the bottom drooped.  Not  all loads I put in there were a flat 18” x 7” pieces of baggage.  I don’t think any were.  This causes the bag to get close enough to the ground that I did touch a few times at speed.  Cordura fabric is considered abrasion resistant.  However they aren’t talking about the type of abrasion that pavement gives at 40 mph on a downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad met me two times on tour and I had him bring some equipment to solve these problems.  We glued some light aluminum sheet to the outside rear edge, where I occasionally touched down, to form skid plates.   We also put some corrugated plastic sheet in the bottom of the pannier.   I oriented the channels along the short axis to keep the bottom from curving as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process was a great learning experience that I would only do again if I couldn’t find something commercially available close to what I wanted.  It is nice to personalize things, but these bags were a great deal of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It is similar to a Pecan Pie, but with a little more body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ingredients"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 frozen pie shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 stick of butter, melted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon vinegar (Apple Cider type is best)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup raisins (gold or regular)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup chopped nuts (normally use pecans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup coconut (shredded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="directions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ochef.com/955.htm"&gt;Blind bake&lt;/a&gt; the 9” pie shell, according to the package instructions.  The pie is really moist and without this step, the crust doesn’t get done.  The trick with blind baking is not burning the outer crust, when you finish the bake with the filling.  You either don’t bake the crust as much, or use a Pie Crust Shield.  Also be carefuly to watch the sides of the pie crust, as they tend to slide into the pie tin.  I hand crimp the edges down, after thawing the frozen pie shell.  (This also makes it look more like you made the shell too.  Is that cheating?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Fully mix melted butter and sugar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Mix in vinegar, vanilla, eggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(make sure butter isn’t too hot, you don’t want to cook the eggs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Add the raisins, nuts and coconut and mix until uniform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Dump everything into the pie shell and level it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Bake at 300 degrees for 40-50 minutes.  The top should be uniformly browned and the center firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this pie is great the day it is baked, it gets better if put inside a gallon sized ziploc freezer bag and frozen.   Something with the freezing of the pie makes the flavors meld together better.  For a really handy pie, cut it before freezing.  Then you can grab it out of the freezer and take it when you need to bring a dessert.   The pie is really hard to cut when frozen, but the pieces get soft very quickly when served.  The pie doesn’t loose its flavor even after a few months in the deep freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="variations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important parts of the recipe are the butter, sugar and egg.  Just like a pecan pie, the egg cooks and gels the pie together.  I tend to like a little more coconut than the recipe and a little more pecans.  Variations on fruit such as dried cherries instead of raisins are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also made this into a bar with a flat dough on parchment paper that it blind baked, then a layer of the filling on top.  Let cool for a while before cutting. These turned out well and were a smaller portion of this rich dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
