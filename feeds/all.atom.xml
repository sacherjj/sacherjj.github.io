&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pound ground chicken&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon onion powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon paprika&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon sea salt + dash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper + dash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup + 1/3 cup almond flour&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 375 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;

We tested both Android and Windows Phone. Android is a multitasking joke.
Coming from webOS, it has a terrible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. Windows Phone has very nice flowing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. We decided to go to Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft representatives promised to get phones and development credits to webOS programmers. Despite many requests, it turned out to be a bunch of hot air.
Sadly, this turned me off to all mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slugged along with trying to make Windows Phone a viable mobile solution for 8 months. We are done trying. After two weeks of switching to Android, we know two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android is painful to use, compared to the grace of webOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LESS&lt;/span&gt; painful than Windows Phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy podcasts. Trying to listen to them on Windows Phone is a complete nightmare. It is so bad that I stopped listening to podcasts completely.
It was one of the many things I slowly gave up, because of the lack of usability on Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a decent collection of audio books on mp3 format. There is only one way that I could make these work on Windows Phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join all mp3s in the right order into one mp3 file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the metadata to indicate podcast genre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through Zune to get it on my phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if I want to listen to other things on the device, I get to lose my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to subscribe to audio books on Audible. I stopped with webOS.
This keeps getting promised for Windows Phone. This exists for Android. Which brings us into another factor: apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dealt with the lack of apps, lack of access to hardware, lack of many things on webOS, because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; is still the best out there.
Two weeks on Android with access to some of the things I have been missing, makes up for a lot of bad &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zune slowly changed from something I have to work through to get stuff on my phone, to something that drove me completely nuts.
I setup WiFi sync, so that I didn’t have to constantly connect my phone to download podcasts and other things to it.
My Windows Phone almost never correctly download these things on its own. Oh, how many times I watched my phone indicate pending downloads that would never come to pass.
WiFi worked to finish the downloads when the software felt merciful and the moon was in the correct region of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted an annoying piece of software that was the gatekeeper for my device, I would just deal with the abomination that is iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File management is a joke. The process of getting a document on and off your phone involves crazy steps of using email, online syncs, and a bit of prayer.
I miss the former days of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive mode, where I could just copy files. Guess what? That is back with Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows Phone has the same multi-task pausing of the iPhone, it was easier to switch between apps than Android. However, if the app isn’t setup with the Mango resume,
the pause before the app resumes is annoying. Really the two platforms are pretty much tied in this race. They both have barely left the starting blocks of usability, compared to webOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the home screen of Android would be more annoying. It turns out to be less so than trying to fit all the apps you want to use on the start screen or looking them up each time in the alphabetical list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I have with Android now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps for my credit union, including deposit check via photo. Charging credit cards via a device on the headphone jack. Tethering via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; for free.
Not quite the WiFi hot spot that webOS gave me, but I can have that too if I decide to root the phone. Edit: Found FoxFi, so WiFi hot spot is back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video player that plays files I just drop on the phone via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;. No waiting 30 minutes to convert the files into the correct format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambling Book Player that takes an audio book with 250 files and handles it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeyondPod which, while not as nice as Dr. Podder on webOS, can actually manager all my podcasting needs on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audible. I have missed Audible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ScummVM is now back on my phone. I was one of the backers for Double Fine’s Adventure game on Kickstarter. I enjoy these things. It was possible with webOS, and now is again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are far from perfect on my Android transition. I have to periodically hit the optimize button to close down rogue apps.
I had to get a 3500 mAh battery to make my phone last a day. But things are better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; I found out that Zune doesn’t want me to go. I cancelled our Zune Pass. Luckily, I had a card stolen and cancelled that card as well.
Now I get an email periodically about how the card is bad. How they can’t charge a monthly fee for a service I cancelled over 2 weeks ago. Zune, the relationship is over.  We broke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one glaring problems that needs to be addressed before it is close to usable.  It all comes down to episode management.  Unfortunately, this is the most important factor of any podcast solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order is allowed, for either oldest first or newest first.  This is great.  What this means is that it will constantly download the oldest or the newest.  Doesn’t matter how many times you have heard them.
It doesn’t matter if you manually marked them as heard and manually deleted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have oldest selected, guess what is downloading back on the phone?  Do you remember those old favorites that you have manually deleted 10 times already?  Yeah, they’re back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are caught up and always listen to the latest, the moment it comes out, then having the newest set and keeping the latest X on your devices works fine.
Myself, I set almost everything to oldest, because if 2 episodes come out before I get back to that podcast, I want to hear them in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t that hard.  When a feed is added, a piece of data is tracked for each episode.  If you have downloaded and listened to a podcast, store the podcast filename or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; with a played flag.
When you are listing episodes, you put a small indicator that this is old and listened to already.  When syncing podcasts, download the oldest or newest that don’t have the listened to flag set.  Done.
This is programming, not rocket science.  The user can manually redownload them if wanted, but otherwise they are dead to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a database that remembers which are played, can we mark them as played without downloading them?  Pretty please?
Some podcasts were online before you were even a glint in your compiler’s linked binaries.  I’m at episode 140 of 200, but selecting oldest will only allow me to start at 1.
Even if episodes were marked as listened correctly, I would have to download and mark all 139 prior episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, can we ask for another great feature?  Add an auto delete after listening option.  Wouldn’t that be great?  You listen to an episode.  It is marked as played in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; and deleted.  Now what happens?
The next episode is automatically downloaded to get up to your keep at least number.  It would be almost like the software was reading my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve almost stopped listening to PodCasts on Windows Phone, because the management of episodes is more work than the enjoyment of listening to them.
Maybe it is too easy to spot really crappy software after using really great software.   If anyone wants to see really good software, look at drPodder on webOS.
It is open source, take a look.  It makes Zune’s implementation looks like a bad student programming project.&lt;/p&gt;

Android is a no holds barred knockout win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turn by turn directions in pre-Mango Windows Phone is a joke.  You must tap the screen to move along, making it totally unusable for navigation when you are driving the car.  The Mango update provides considerably increased driving instructions.
If you follow the route given, the system works very well.  If you do not, you will soon want to through your phone out your car window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used each phone’s direction solution to “find” my way to work.  Due to heavy construction, the fastest route is not obvious.  This is a good way of figuring out how annoying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; software will be, by driving in a manner that it considers idiotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first day was with Android 2.3.5.  I started Navigation, tapped Speak Navigation, and rattled off my work address.  It parsed the address correctly.  I deviated from the proposed route no less than ten times.
When I went off route, the phone didn’t utter a peep, it just recalculated a route faster than any mapping solution I have ever used.  Voice prompts were there when needed, but not annoying at all.
After determining that the routing works as well as TeleNav, this would be my preferred navigation solution on Android.  TeleNav give you a speak destination option, but it does not parse the speech to text as well as Navigate.
If you want to use TeleNav for the routing, you can let Navigate hear your location then select which you wish to use for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second day was with Windows Phone 7.5 beta.  I started Maps and tapped the directions arrow, then typed in my work address.  Then I started navigating.  No voice destination is available in Maps or TeleNav.
The routing looks fine.  Now I go off route.  My phone tells me that I have gone off track and I can tap the screen to reroute.  Excuse me?  I have to tap the screen to reroute?
Whoever came up with this idea is the same guy who puts 2 “Are you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SURE&lt;/span&gt; you want to close this App?” dialogs, when you just want to get out of the program.
So I held the phone in my hand, because I knew I would have to tap the screen after each mile or so leg, when it thinks I should get “back on track”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound up turning off Maps about halfway to work, to keep me from throwing the phone out the window.  A complete and utter usability failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android wins this round.  Still not sure if it is enough to get past the complete ease of use failure that is the Android system in general, so I’m still using both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and still missing webOS.&lt;/p&gt;

Moving from this almost clairvoyant app to the integrated podcast ability of Windows Phone is quite jarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be outlining the current successes and fails with Windows Phone which keep it from being an enjoyable podcasting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="adding-podcasts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding podcasts from the device is only possible by searching the Zune podcast library.  If the podcast does not exists in the library, you cannot add it from the phone.
If you have an obscure podcast, you can add an rss feed through the Zune desktop software.  Not at all ideal, but it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="playback-order-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playback Order (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up a podcast, you can specify the number of episodes you wish to download to the phone at a time and the order (oldest or newest first.)  This makes sense.
Some podcasts are episodic and it would be confusing to listen to them in anything but chronological order.  News podcasts might make more sense to listen to the latest first and the older if you have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you want to listen to them from oldest to newest for a podcast that has been out for years?  That brings us to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="episode-management-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Episode Management (Fail)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to many podcasts that have been around far before Windows Phone was a twinkle in a cell carrier’s eyes.  So I setup a new podcast that I am up to episode 107 on my current device.  I listen to it oldest first and set a sync of 3.
My Windows Phone will download Episodes 1, 2, and 3.  Then I can tap hold and mark as read.  However, I cannot do this until the episode is downloaded.  So the process of catching up is to download each episode and mark it as read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tap and hold an undownloaded, unplayed episode should have an option to mark as played.  Ideally, there would be some functionality to “catch up” and mark all as played.
This would be more useful in a majority of cases when you are transitioning from a device where you have been a loyal listener.  If you set all to read and then have to reset the last 2 or 3 to unread, this is still a faster experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="video-support-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Support (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Phone handles video podcasts very well.  Playback is crisp in visuals and program performance and start up time.  I don”t see anything in video that is a problem, other than the problems also common to any style podcast in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bookmarks-occasional-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bookmarks (occasional Fail)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are much longer than songs.  It is not uncommon for them to pass 90 minutes.  Most people won”t listen to them at one sitting.  The podcast player should remember time into each episode of each show to which a listener has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmarks seem to work as expected in video podcasts.  However, I have had mixed results with audio, with many times getting no bookmark.  Instead of a complete oversight, which I originally assumed, it seems to be bugs in the process.
What I am running is still beta code, so we will have to wait to see if this is addressed in the version of Mango sent down to phones.  If you play from the main screen and are careful to pause, it seems to work.  Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a2dp-bluetooth-support-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; Bluetooth Support (Fail)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bluetooth support on Windows Phone is woefully lacking, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; profile seems to work perfectly for any audio only component.  When you bring video into the mix, nothing you do will make audio stream through your Bluetooth device.
This affects video podcasts along with all video on the device, including YouTube, local videos, and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you will watch no video on the phone, you will find &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; to satisfy you.  But with only partial support, you have no choice other than to use wired headphones if you consume any video at all.  This makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="streaming-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streaming (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to listen to an episode that you have not downloaded, no problem.  Streaming the episode worked great for both audio and video playback.  As long as you used those wired headphones for the video, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="control-from-other-apps-win"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control from Other Apps (Win)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows Phone is not anywhere close to the multitasking that was enjoyed in webOS, they control of audio playback while moving around other apps works well.
If you at inside another application and wish to pause playback (or other controls, such as skipping a track) you simply hit either volume button.  The first touch of a volume button does not change the volume, but drops down a media control panel.
From here you can pause and go forward or back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting past the pain of catching up all the shows, it should work fine for steady state listening.  Heaven help me if I ever get behind again and just want to catch up.  I’ll be using this for my daily podcasts for a while and see how it goes.
Sure wish I could get my missing podcasts back though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I purchased an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive off eBay, slightly cheaper than I would get it from Sprint under contract.  I’ve been using it as a WiFi only device for about a week.
Wednesday night, I upgraded it to the developer’s release of Mango, the future update for Windows Phone.  Last night, I added this phone to our third “testing” line on Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will detail the pain points that will exist on doing a webOS to Windows Phone (and specifically the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive) transition.
I will also highlight the cool things I see that aren’t possible on webOS (at least Sprint available webOS phones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="multitasking-vs-multipausing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MultiTasking vs MultiPausing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;webOS is still the best multitasking platform for mobile, full stop.  Windows Phone acts much like iOS, where apps are put into a pause state and resumed when reloaded.
The Arrive has three “soft” buttons on the front for Back, Windows, and Search.  These are needed to navigate and annoying at the same time.
I can’t tell you how often I accidentally tapped search and was bounced into Bing search.  Then a Back tap resumes where you were in a variably amount of time, depending on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the development documentation, there is a term for preparing your application for this pause: “Tombstoning”.
Sit there and act dead and I’ll let you know when you can come out of the coffin.  Mango supposedly has faster resume, but like the iOS transition a short while ago,
the apps must be coded to use this for a faster resume.  Most I’ve used have not been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the back button takes you to a similar view as card mode on webOS.  This isn’t nearly as nice, but I can work with it.  The cards will be a list of the last 5
(or less) apps that you have opened.  You will always start at the right and can swipe to the left in chronological order.  webOS this sure isn’t, but I can deal.
It isn’t as bad as I expected it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notifications"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another feature where webOS tops the mobile space.  Others are getting close, but not there yet.  Windows Phone uses live tiles on the home screen to display some of this information.
However, there is not one place to go to see all that has happened.  I can live with Windows Phone version, but it is vastly inferior.  The unlock screen shows many of the “notifications”,
which is slightly like the locked display on webOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="calendars"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calendars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I purchased our webOS phones, over two years ago, we started expanding into the capabilities of webOS Synergy.  I use a work Exchange calendar, Google personal,
and my wife used two Google calendars for work and personal.  All of these show up on my Pre with no effort other than linking my Google account.  This is not the case with Windows Phone.
It is not even possible to see multiple calendars for one account in the current release of Windows Phone.
When I upgraded to Mango, this was possible, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joesacher.com/blog/tech/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/"&gt;only after a hack that I detailed in this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you only have to do this once, I call the Calendar a draw (once Mango comes out, that is.)  webOS has a few nicer features, but Windows Phone is 5x faster in getting through the info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="touchstone"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Touchstone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wireless charging setup for webOS phones and tablets is something that isn’t thought about, until you are plugging cabled into phones for the first time on two years.
I have my Pre sitting right in front of my keyboard on a Touchstone, right now.  When I leave my desk area, I just scoop it up.  It is there to tap songs or quickly look at notifications.
Just a handy setup.  This will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="podcasts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used drPodder for webOS, since early betas.  It is a great app with the ability to download podcasts directly from your phone, or stream them.  It supports audio and video,
as well as some advanced renaming features.  The negatives of using drPodder are all related to the error filled media playing implementation of webOS 1.4.5, where my Pre is stuck.
I just expect the last 6-10 seconds of a podcast to get cut off.  It just happens.  Starting a podcast playing back (even a downloaded one) can take up to 10 seconds.
If my Pre starts getting hot for some reason, playback slows to 80% speed.  But drPodder makes listening to and managing podcasts a breeze.  After playing, the file can be auto deleted.
You can play from bottom or top (oldest to newest or reverse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mango has added podcasts directly into the Zune media system.  I was able to find a majority of the podcasts I listen to in the directory.
I am not used to the immediate response of the software, when lags where just part of the game with webOS.
The current setting is to download audio and video only when WiFi is connected, but this is configurable.
I cannot find a way to manually add an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed to a podcast not in the Zune directory.  So immediately, I’m missing 3 of my normal podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have options of how many of each podcast to download, if you should get oldest or newest first, and if you should play them from oldest or newest.
So it seems to replace most functionality of drPodder.  But not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the podcasts I listen to are nearly 90 minutes.  I almost never listen to them at one sitting.  On webOS, drPodder just keeps my last place and when I start that episode again,
I’m just slightly before when I stopped.  If I leave the podcast in Zune player, and go back to it in the future, I’m right back at the beginning.  This has got to be a joke, right?
They aren’t bookmarking audio podcasts?  It looks like they are handled just like songs.  This is a complete and utter fail and makes audio podcast listening impossible on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for video podcasts, they are storing the position for each one.  I can pause 4 different episodes of a podcast, 3 different ones of another, and all will restore at the correct position.
So I have to download video versions of the podcasts that have them and listen to that on my drive into work, when I will never be looking at the video.
Have I been spoiled too much by drPodder, or is this implementation just not well formed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasting on Windows Phone is a fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="video-playback"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Playback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be it video podcasts or video files that you loaded on the phone via Zune software (which encodes them), they all play great.  However, I have not been able to figure out how to make
sound for Video come out over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; headsets.  Audio works great.  However, once you start a video, it either comes out of the speaker or wired headphones.  I’m not sure if this is an
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive fail or a Windows Phone issue in general.  Why isn’t audio just audio.  Just when I thought that I could used the video versions of a podcast to get past the bookmark issue,
now I can’t use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; headphones for that.  You seriously have to be kidding me.  This is a major annoyance and needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-browser"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to describe the web browser in current Windows Phone, other than crap.  It was really bad.  The Mango update essentially loads &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE9&lt;/span&gt; onto your phone.  While this is still
a step back from the Chrome or Firefox that I’m used to on the desktop, it is a decent mobile browser.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACID3&lt;/span&gt; test jumps from a 12 to a 95, between current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; and Mango.  For most browse
ability, the Windows Phone wins over my old Palm Pre.  This is a combination of screen size and processor speed.  However, there are sites which my Pre can open that Windows Phone Mango
will not.  For getting something done all over the web, webOS still wins here.  For most use, the speed of the newer phone and clean &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; is on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="camera"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Pre3 was released, I think this would be equal or slightly into webOS for functionality.  Video editing on the Pre is pretty cool.  However, my Pre cannot shoot a clear shot closer
than 8 inches.  Scanning barcodes with the phone? Don’t make me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arrive has a 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt; autofocus camera, which allows me to shoot as close as 2-3 cm.  Dedicated camera button that never seems to freeze for up to 20 seconds when I want to load it, as my
aging Pre will do occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also automated uploads to SkyDrive (Microsoft’s cloud storage) if you desire.  This is a hands down win for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive and Windows Phone.  The uploads to Facebook and other
upload features that a almost never using on the Pre are also available here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="apps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Phone Marketplace isn’t iOS or Android level yet, but there are Apps.  More and better games than available for webOS.  The one missing app that I hope they get soon is Pandora.
I have gotten used to listening to a mellow mix over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A2DP&lt;/span&gt; headphones while I work.  This will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know one app that is pretty cool?  Netflix.  Streaming on my phone.  Oh, yeah.  These are the things that may push past any of the pain.  The real apps we have been waiting for on webOS
for two years.  While there are some missing innovative apps that are unique to webOS, Windows Phone is walking to the finish line to win on this one.  They have the apps that I hoped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;
scale would bring to webOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bing-search"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bing Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Windows Phone have an app to identify songs?  Yes, but with Mango it is baked into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; itself.  (This is also why Shazam has upped their price to $5.99 for Windows Phone, as
they will be obsolete when the Mango update pushes out.)  To search for music in Mango, tap the search button and tap the music icon at the bottom.  Then let the phone listen.
It does a decent job identifying music, with a link to the Zune marketplace if you want to purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have visual search, that allows you to photograph text with the camera and translate it into other languages, or pull up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QR&lt;/span&gt; code, Microsoft Tags, UPCs for books, CDs, DVDs.
It isn’t perfect with the text, but better than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have voice search.  This works amazingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="speech-to-text-and-text-to-speech"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speech to Text and Text to Speech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in trying this out on Android, as Molly Wood indicated that she uses it in more places than just searching.  However, I found it very useful.  If you hold down the windows key,
you activate voice mode.  I may say: “text Amy”, it will respond with which of my wife’s numbers I should text.  I say “Google” for her Google Voice number.  It then says “Texting Amy Sacher”
and goes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; composition mode.  Then I say what I want to text.  It gets it down fairly accurately and reads it back to me.  I can say “Send”, “Try Again”, or “Cancel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Open” followed by any installed app name works to start up that app.  “Call” followed by a phone number works as long as you say each digit and don’t call 18 “eighteen” instead of “one, eight”.
If it doesn’t recognize a valid verb noun combo, it will bing search for the text you spoke.  This blows away the functionality that I’ve played with on the Pre2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="trial-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trial Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone apps allow trial versions.  This would be fairly simple to hack around in webOS and is possible, because the apps are compiled.
I have tried many apps and it keeps be from buying bad apps, which is have done many times on webOS.  This is good for keeping the collection of apps strong.
If you try 3 apps to provide one service, download all the trials.  Then buy the one you like, but review all three.  This will reward good developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m downloading all the trials of Instapaper apps right now.  Let the best app win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tethering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tethering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the features that I use on my webOS phone, tethering for free on Sprint is the most needed, due to now having the Touchpad.  This is easy on both webOS and Android.
I’m not sure if this is possible with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; Arrive and Windows Mobile, yet.  I believe some type of tethering will be available with Mango, but if you can do it without the extra
fee is yet to be seen.  This may be the deal breaker that takes me to Android.  But comparing webOS to Windows Phone, webOS knocks it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="homebrew"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no debate on this one.  webOS homebrew is the only thing that kept people on webOS in the dark days (1) before &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; acquisition.  It is also how people are staying on webOS with
FrankenPre2s and other methods of staying on their carrier and getting through the dark days (2) after the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; cancellation.  There is not a more open system than webOS, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-files-on-device"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Files on Device&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; mode for Windows Phone.  Like iTunes on iOS, you go through Zune.  This is annoying.  The only other real option is going through SkyDrive.
This worked to edit an Office document on the phone from SkyDrive and push it back up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With webOS stock, you can connect your phone to your computer as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive.  Copy either way.  All good.  With a little WebOSInternals, you can &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; into the phone and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt; files with the
phone just being on the same network.  This is an easy webOS win and I have many “work arounds” to learn if I will be staying on Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="development"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this doesn’t affect strictly users, I see the development environment for each platform pretty well matched.  There are cool things that webOS does where Windows Phone can’t match,
and vice versa.  We are still waiting for mic access and other hardware access on webOS.  Both platforms are much nicer than trying to develop for Android.  I’m looking into MonoGame to port
apps to Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, and possibly webOS, in addition to the native support on Windows Phone, Windows, and XBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a fun little scripting app on the phone called TouchDevelop.  This exposes most if not all the phone’s capabilities for your little mini programs.  I made a 4 line program
that prompted me to talk, converted Speech to Text, then used Text to Speech to read it back to me.  I’m sure I’ll mes with this more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part that I will have trouble working past is if I can’t get tethering on my Windows Phone.   I will be getting an Android phone via our two year upgrade discount, to test that
platform as well (most likely a Nexus S).  No conclusions what platform I’m landing on yet, still much more research to be done.  Unlike webOS, the hardware is solid.
Performance of individual apps blow away my aging webOS hardware.  However, there are software fixes that are still needed.  Since Mango will not hit for a month or more, these will be a
while in coming.’, ‘webOS to Windows Phone: What’s Missing?&lt;/p&gt;

Many engineers spent many hours making this work seamlessly.  But to the user, it “just happened”.)  You don’t realize how nice this is, until you try a system that doesn’t really have it.  Windows Phone 7 with NoDo (the current “up to date” version for the public) has this problem.  The update due out September or October called Mango (or Windows phone 7.5) enables more Synergy like features, such as multiple calendars.  However, Google doesn’t allow you to select more than one.  But there’s a hack for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most Windows Phone 7 users who are waiting for the Mango release, this won’t be useful yet.  But you can go through the steps if you want, and it will magically show all your Google calendars when you get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is only selecting the primary calendar to sync to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP7&lt;/span&gt; calendar.   In my situation, I have an Exchange Work calendar and a Google Personal calendar.  Both of those showed up with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP7&lt;/span&gt; NoDo.  What was missing is my wife’s Google Work and Personal calendars.  Here is how I enabled them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google will allow you to configure the calendar to sync if it believes you are an iOS device.  If you have access to an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, etc.) you can use those to do this.  Otherwise, we will just fake it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fake an iPhone, I used Google Chrome.  You will want to start up the browser on the command line.  So open up a Command Shell and “cd” (change directory) into the proper directory for chrome.exe.  If you don’t know where this is, right-click on the shortcut in Windows and select Properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to close down any Chrome browsers you may have open before you do this.  We will paste the following into your command prompt to start Chrome as an iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;chrome.exe --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_0 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Mobile/8A293 Safari/6531.22.7"

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Browse to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://m.google.com/sync"&gt;http://m.google.com/sync&lt;/a&gt;.  You should see something similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/multiple-google-calendars-on-windows-phone-mango/GC_UnChecked.png" style="width: 468px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Click on WindowsPhone and you will see your calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="legend"&gt;
Notice only your main calendar is checked.  No problem, check the others.  But that doesn’t work.  Google has blocked this with JavaScript.  We just need to turn JavaScript off.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 462px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The too long didn’t read version of this post is this: Download HandBrake, render using the iPad Preset and change frame rate to Same as Source.  Upload to Touchpad and be happy.  If you care about some of the testing I did, continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a high end &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; video file, to take advantage of the full resolution of the Touchpad.  The video I played with is a BluRay version of Pixar’s Partly Cloudy.  This is a 1080p video (1920x1080), with 5.1 channel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC3&lt;/span&gt; sound (48 kHz and 16 bit).  This is most likely the highest video quality source that people will use for Touchpad encoding.  Runtime is 5:48 with 23.976 frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two pieces of software I used are Format Factory (now a dead link) and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/"&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; (Windows, Mac, Linux. Tested on the Windows version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First render was in Format Factory with the iPad setting at 720x480 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPEG4&lt;/span&gt;.  This rendered slightly faster than I had been seeing with HandBrake.  There is a noticeable quality loss with stretching the 720 out to the Touchpad’s 1024 width, but the video is very watchable.  If you did not have a 1024 width video to compare it to, you would not see an issue.  File Size 47.0 Mb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the same iPad setting and bumped the resolution to 1024x768, keeping all the other settings the same.  What surprised me is the file size dropped to 46.6 Mb.  Looking closer, I noticed that the video bit rate is fixed at 1000 kbs, rather than using HandBrake’s quality style setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HandBrake has a video format for the iPad at 1024 width with aspect ratio set height (but steps width down to source video width if smaller than 1024).  The only change I made before I ran this encoding was to set frame rate as Same as Source.  (It was defaulted to 29.97.)  The encoding takes longer than Format Factory (1.1-1.4x).  The file size came out to 69.8 Mb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at both 1024 wide videos on the Touchpad, you can see the difference between Format Factory’s 1120 kbs data rate and HandBrake’s 1672 kbs data rate.  There was quite a bit of motion blocking artifacts with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FF&lt;/span&gt;’s encode.  The added time to render due to detecting quality of the frame dynamically is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upped the Format Factory setting to use 1500 kbs video data rate (for similar to HandBrake’s total data rate) to do an apples to apples comparison.  File size came out to 67.9 Mb, so pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the two on the Touchpad, they are very hard to tell apart most of the time.  The biggest issues is with horizontal streaking on single color backgrounds for the Format Factory version.  By going with a fixed bit rate, rather than the HandBrake’s quality based setting, you also get blocking during highly changing scenes.  HandBrake will use less data during the static scenes, but more during dynamic scenes, resulting in a better encoding at the same overall file size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rendered some of the files that I have ripped from my DVDs (most 640 x proper aspect ratio height) through HandBrake, using the iPad profile.  These play great.  The Touchpad had no issues with m4v or mp4 file extension for the H.264 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPEG&lt;/span&gt; 4 files these apps were generating. It will not display the Xvid based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPEG4&lt;/span&gt; files that I have encoded for use with my media players and Boxee Box before H.264 was the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching video on the Touchpad just reminds you how great the audio on this thing sounds.  Really a good video viewing experience.  Do some transcoding and enjoy your moving picture shows.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Touchpad Keyboard is mostly a success.  My largest annoyances with it can be addressed with software fixes in future WebOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I expected the chicklet keys to be annoying, compared to a full sized keyboard.  It was surprising to me that they were not.  The keys depress quickly, to give a feeling of depth, before stopping.  I have no trouble typing as fast as I would on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-good"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am listening to music on the Touchpad as I type. When a song pops up that I’m not enjoying, I tap the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FF&lt;/span&gt; button at the top of the keyboard and keep going.  This is more handy than I expected, as most media keys on desktop keyboards have gone unused by me.  Possibly it is the feeling that the Touchpad is just the monitor and you want to do everything on the keyboard as you are working.  It works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the WebOS specific keys.  In addition to being a very functional keyboard, it integrates well with WebOS for control of power, volume, playback, brightness, show/hide for virtual keyboard, immediate jump to Just Type, and dedicated “card view” button.  Of these, Just Type is amazing.  I’m typing something and think, “hmm, I wonder about subject x”.  Tap the magnifying glass button above the 1 key, type “subject x” and tap enter.  A web page with the Google search pops up.  (Before writing this, I had no idea that Subject X was a character in a Marvel comic book. Learn something new every day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will have many points in the Bad and Ugly category below. This doesn’t mean that it isn’t a good keyboard. For the most part these failings are software that I hope are addressed in future WebOS versions. The hardware is good enough to make this a great keyboard experience with the right supporting code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bad"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hardware design issues can be seem by just observing the keyboard before even using it.  These don’t detract terribly from the use of the keyboard, but if it isn’t intuitive or obvious, it is usually a design fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is no indication of how to change the batteries.  Without reading the instructions, I did not know how to slide the battery cover.  A simple arrow on the cover would completely solve this issue.  The battery life is supposed to be good enough that batteries last for months. We won’t have the instructions by then, I hope I remember which direction to slide the cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the power switch has two settings: black and slightly whiter black. It is difficult to know which setting is “on”.  This goes away with training of what is the right direction, but a product should be designed to be able to be picked up and used. These problems could be fixed with a new battery cover, adding a 1 and 0 icon for power and the cover removal arrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve run into unintended key repeats twice in about 3 hours of typing. I’ll be typing the word “most” and get mooooooooooost. This could be either a hardware or software problem.  It doesn’t really feel like the key contacts are sticking, but it would be possible under the key without me seeing it.  It would also be possible for the software to be hanging for just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Touchpad has two styles of correction for words it thinks are wrong. First, if it is pretty sure that you are wrong and it knows what is right, it will do an auto correction. This replaces the word you typed with the “correct” one and underlines the word in gray.  The second method is when the correct fix is not known, so the incorrect word is left underlined in red. The user may tap that word and select the correction or enter it into the dictionary if the word typed was actually correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a word is auto corrected and what you typed is correct, you press Delete and the original is restored. That is a great idea, but is only effective if you are a slow typist.  With the Bluetooth keyboard, you are into the next word before you realize that it made a correction.  After you have typed a new letter, you can no longer correct it quickly with Delete.  You must delete the letter(s) you typed, delete the gray underlined word, retype the word, hit space, hit delete to undo the auto correction which will happen again, hit space again and continue.  Optionally, you can tap the gray underlined word to restore the original word, but this takes you off the keyboard so it totally depends on the length of the word as to which is faster.  This restored word will be underlined in red, so tapping it and adding to the dictionary will eliminate the problem with this word in the future.  Otherwise the Touchpad will continue to replace it each time it is typed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do have the option of disabling Auto Correct in the Text Assist App in Settings.  I disabled it while typing the last two paragraphs and made enough mistakes it would have auto corrected, that I lost time over what I saved fixing “good” words.  I have it back on and will leave it that way.  As you train the dictionary to the vernacular you use, this will be less and less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-ugly"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebOS is an elegant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.  That is part of what draws people into it.  The operation is intuitive and clean.  Sadly, this stops when a keyboard is introduced.  There is a card view button, but you can’t do anything with it.  It only saves you an up swipe.  Here is how it should function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tap the card view button.  Press left or right arrow to select different cards.  Tap Enter or Down Arrow to bring the card to full screen. Maybe Control+Up would close the currently selected card. Nice.  Elegant.  WebOS-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Just Type search key is great. From anywhere, I can jump to a system wide search.  Then it fails to be like WebOS on the keyboard.  Here is how it should function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tap the Just Type button.  Type what you want to search.  Then the Up and Down keys allow you to select different options from the default.  Then press Enter to go to the one you selected.  This is a situation where two key taps on down would be faster than reaching over to tap the screen.  And to blow our minds with usefulness, how about Control+Left or Right to switch between All, Contacts, Content, or Actions.  That would be awesome.  Elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest of the ugly is the lack of expected functionality of the keyboard while you are typing.  I ran into this over a dozen times and it makes using the Touchpad for final editing a frustrating experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting text should be possible by holding down Shift and using arrow keys.  This works exactly as it should when you are either in a text area that has less than a screen full of text in it or is scrolled to the top of the text buffer.  If you are in the middle of a multi screen document and try a selection with either Shift+Left/Right or Shift+Up/Down, you get a little highlighted and then the screen tries to scroll up or down with every arrow key push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just deleted 6 words and retyped them, because I couldn’t do a Cut and Paste quicker.  That is a big fail. It is unusable.  I must resort to the tap and hold, tap Select, drag edges to region and Cut or Copy, so I only do this for sentence length or longer text sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me into the second problem with productivity while editing on the Touchpad.  Copy and Paste.  Why doesn’t Control + X, C, and V function?  It is inexcusable on a business class device that will be used for document editing.  I have used it over a dozen times editing this post and follow it up with having to use the slower methods of the touch screen, as I remember that it doesn’t work.  It is almost subconscious for anyone that has done editing on the computer.  It is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAY&lt;/span&gt; to copy and paste if you are using a hardware keyboard, full stop.  Fix this, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Touchpad Keyboard to actually do work on the Touchpad.  In its current state, it is great for getting thoughts down.  However, doing the final polishing is painful.  I forced myself to use the Touchpad for this entire article.  In reality, I will be switching back to the laptop for any final editing until the two major text editing issues are addressed, unless I don’t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If the app has a problem parsing the book for any reason, you are done.  With no back gesture on the Touchpad, there is no way to back out of the crashed book load.  Each time you start the app, it will load the file into a crash situation.  (This doesn’t crash the Touchpad, just the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to delete the Kindle App and redownload.  I’m poking in the source to see if there is a clearer way to test books against the hybrid components that parse the ebook files, without requiring this tedious reload.  You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;

This is very easy to load onto my Kindle device to read.  Unfortunately, the current Kindle app on the Touchpad does not allow loading ebooks other than downloading from Amazon.  This is unfortunate and makes the Touchpad a poor replacement for my Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not know if the Kindle App on the Touchpad could even handle .mobi format files, if I could get them there.  Amazon purchased MobiPocket and their original ebook format was only slightly modified .mobi file.  I assumed that the reader plugin would understand the .mobi format and I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books for your Kindle app are stored in the /media/internal/.palmkindle directory.  The book files have strange names such as B000JMLFLW_EBOK.azw.  I’m not sure if this is the same on each device for a given book, but I would assume so.  Best guess is that it is just the primary key for that book in Amazon’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;.  This is the file for a free book of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Pride and Prejudice&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by Jane Austen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a subdirectory holding the cover images, called appropriately “coverCache”.  Inside there, you will find up to three files of the format: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;B000JMLFLW&lt;/span&gt;-[small|medium|large].jpg.  Large does not exist for all books.  Large is 333x500, Medium is 120x180, and Small is 52x78.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to try a copy of John Ringo’s &lt;em&gt;When the Devil Dances&lt;/em&gt; that I had purchased from webscription.net.  I replaced the original B000JMLFLW_EBOK.azw with the .mobi format of that book using the same name.  Then I saved images for all three sizes with the same prefix.  When I ejected the Touchpad, the ebook loaded correctly, but the cover image did not change for the thumbnail style of books display.  When I changed to a list view, the image was correct.  I had not gone into list mode before, so I am guessing that caching is used to only load images once.  This makes sense, as the book cover is not a rapidly changing asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/loading-mobi-books-into-touchpads-kindle-app/kindle_2011-02-08_231413.png" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;At this point I rebooted, to try to uncache the cover image.  This worked.  I now had a book that looked correct in the thumbnail view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Tapping on the book loaded &lt;em&gt;When the Devil Dances&lt;/em&gt; with an expected title up top of &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book had no issues being read.  So all that is needed is updating the book database to correct the title.  That would complete the hack.  I have no idea how this will interface with Amazon syncing for distance read.  I have turned off syncing before I started messing with this to keep from “mucking things up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this proves is that sideloading non-Amazon sourced books should be fairly trivial to add to the Kindle App.  It would just require updating the database to show the new books and loading a .mobi file and cover images.  Amazon doesn’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/book-review/playing-for-pizza.jpg" style="width: 164px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I was intrigued when I read the summary of this book.  A novel by John Grisham about a third string &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; quarterback, escaping his terrible past to play professional football in Italy.  Nothing about lawyers?  This sounds interesting, if not just to figure out why John described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally the novel isn’t quite as good, when an author writes completely out of their “comfort zone”.  That is definitely the case here.  It doesn’t have the same fire as a typical Grisham thriller.  That isn’t to say it is a bad book.  I enjoyed the read and it was fun to see a different side of this author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts with Rick Dockery in a hospital bed, after the worst game of his varied &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; career.  In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFC&lt;/span&gt; Championship game, this third string player is forced into the game with 11 minutes left.  The Browns are up 20-0.  Rick manages to toss enough interceptions to loose the game and Cleveland’s Super Bowl ticket.  The last hit of the game mercifully knocks him senseless and offers a day with no memory of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All bridges burned, Rick’s only available job is playing for the Parma Panthers in Italy, where American Football ranks at near the bottom of all sports.  Games are free, yet less than a couple hundred attend.  Only three Americans are allowed per team and they are the only players paid any money.  It seemed like the same as a Softball league in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, a proud hobby to most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description of the four hour Italian meals made me want to go to Italy, just for the food.  It was obvious that Grisham had spent some time in Italy and really wanted to give the read an appreciation of the country.  I wish his character development was as endearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick is a typical womanizing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; player at the start of the novel.  He doesn’t seem to change.  Some of the characters are fleshed out well, but most are flat.  It is a story about an American &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; player in Italy.  That is it.  The plot could have used much more development and choices for story direction at times were just boring.  The romance near the end of the book is empty.  I felt that Rick and his girlfriend were together because it was convenient.  I had hoped for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book would have been harder to get published, if written by a non-famous author.    If you are not a fan of football, you will probably not enjoy this novel.  Most of the conflicts and growth occur only in relation to football.  Rick doesn’t grow much as a person, otherwise.  It is worth reading and is a short and quick book.  I think the library is a great place to get a copy, because you probably won’t want to read it again.&lt;/p&gt;

The password field for the WiFi key is frustrating.
The last character is only shown for a second or two, then it too fades into the dots of obscurity.  This is fine in normal use with passwords you are used to typing, but a WiFi key is complex and entered only once per new device.
When you add to this a finiky WiFi network acceptance, you have time after time frustration.  The key is entered and network selected (even with a check mark!), but for some reason the Touchpad won’t accept anything but Cancel.
Guess who gets to type the key in again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out how to view a key as I enter it and validate the key, so I can be sure the passcode part of the network acceptance is valid.  If I had done this the first time I started to enter our complex key, I would have only had to type it once and been able to verify it easily.  Typing 64 characters with only vision on the last one is a little too tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLEASE&lt;/span&gt; make an option to show the passcode.  All you have to do is change the enyo options of the text box.  Entering a passcode for WiFi should not be this hard.  If it must be secure by default, put a check box that allows “Show Passcode”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my work around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 444px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/01-Join-Network.png" style="width: 444px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;When you have the WiFi network selection open, tap on the “+ Join Network”.  The image was captured before the Touchpad located any WiFi networks.  Normally, you will see your network and possibly others above the “+ Join Network” option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/02-Join-Network-Open.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;This will open a dialog that is normally used for you to enter the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSID&lt;/span&gt; of a hidden WiFi network.  Instead, we are typing our WiFi passcode in plain text (oh, glorious plain text).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/03-Type-and-Select-All.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;You can now see all characters and scroll back and forth to verify everything is correct (just tap and drag to the left or right.)  When it looks good, tap and hold to bring up the Select menu.  Choose Select All.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/05-Hold-for-Copy.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Now with everything selected, tap and hold again for the Copy menu.  Select Copy and you have your WiFi key in your clipboard.  Tap cancel and select your WiFi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/hp-touchpad-wifi/06-Hold-for-Paste.png" style="width: 443px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Tap and hold in the passcode field and you can select Paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/book-review/Treason-DonBrown.png" style="width: 170px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This used to be offered as a free book for the Kindle and was one of many I added to my account after receiving my Kindle. (If its free, its for me, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading the author “Don Brown” on the cover of this novel, I was mistaking it for a more famous Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code). As I read the military themes unfold, my mind then played further tricks on me as I made a connection with Dale Brown’s military styled novels as the author.  None of this is important in discussing the merits and faults of this novel, which shares more with John Grisham than either of the other two authors mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Treason&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in Don Brown’s Navy Justice series, which follows Navy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; (Judge Advocate General) Lieutenant Zack Brewer through two major cases.  This feels familiar to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; series. Don Brown is a former &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; Officer and thus the similarities between the two are actually similarities between both and the actual Military Justice System of the United States.  All interactions and procedures portrayed in the book seem real and believable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an average novel, but not a great one. I was confused by the level of discussion of faith throughout the book, tempered mostly by my assumption that the author was one of those discussed above. It was surprising that they would break form and include some discussion of Christian faith and beliefs, when not directly germane to the plot. As a Christian, I actually enjoyed what it added to the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the novel, I realized that the publisher is Zondervan, one of the largest Bible and Evangelical Christian book publishers.  Thus the inclusion of Christian themes is less surprising.  I actually found it much more subtle than other novels with tangential Christian teaching which I have read in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard not to compare this book to works from John Grisham, who is after all a master of the courtroom novel. Unfortunately, Don Brown does not quite make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel opens with Muslim leaders discussing the infiltration of sleeper agents into the United States Armed Forces.  As the story unfolds, we learn that a lawsuit was won which allowed Muslim Chaplains into the Armed Forces. Some of these Chaplains are handlers to infiltrate and create a network of like minded Muslim soldiers to attack the enemy from within.  This is truly a scary premise and one which is an undeniably fertile ground for a great story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim soldiers are committing acts of terror.  One instance, a soldier brings grenades to a Christian church where a discussion of Islam was occurring.  The bomber demands that the preacher admit that Mohammed is the one true prophet and explodes two grenades when the preacher stands his ground.  Many are killed, along with the attacker. In a second instance, a sniper assassinates the Ambassador from Israel, before committing suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first trial in the book is mostly for setting the ball rolling and introducing the main players.  A Navy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEAL&lt;/span&gt; is accused of raping an officer, who is the niece of a prominent Senator.  I found it amusing that the novel included a token “Reverend” whose only preaching occurs by talking about oppressed minorities to the press. This just rings a little too true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach is prosecuting the case against a beautiful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; officer, who hates Zach due to a previous encounter.  Throughout the trial, the truth is unknown. The rape accusation sounds fishy and Zach is troubled by his thought that he might not be doing the correct thing in putting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEAL&lt;/span&gt; away. Unfortunately, this theme is almost immediately dropped at the conclusion of the first trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a F-18 Hornet is destroyed by another jihadist, who plants explosives in the fighter. This is the event which starts the investigation of the main case in the novel.  The United States vs the 3 Chaplains who ran the jihadists in the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we have cross plots of possible future political aspirations of the young Lieutenant Zack with a possible pairing with the famous Senator’s niece.  The problem is the main meat and potatoes of the novel is the second trial.  This is where the novel falters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President of the United States allows cameras into the courtroom for the first time in a Court Marshal. I initially wondered why and realized later that it was for the benefit of the writer. Far too often, when major portions of the case were to happen, the plot was moved forward by tangential characters hearing the summary on the evening news.  It seems as though the author assumed all readers would skim this part anyway, so he did the skimming for them.  The drama is in the courtroom: what is said, what is done.  The novel is lesser for leaving much of this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it is a novel I enjoyed reading, but wouldn’t read again. The plot was predictable and linear. Characters one dimensional with little ambiguity. Everything is very black and white. I assumed the ending in the first few chapters and unfortunately was absolutely correct.  Surprises were few and far between.  I my eventually read the other two books in this series, but I’m in not rush to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it is an amazing piece of technology. Slicker than any Android tablets that I have tried, but not quite as polished as an iPad. However, for me the usability if far above an iPad, whose “multitasking” is a joke compared to the Touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Mostly build Smart Domino board top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received my boards from the DorkbotPDX group order.  While the purple solder mask is “interesting”.  The board quality is beautiful.  This was the first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; soldering I’ve ever done.  I started with tinning the pads with my normal iron and normal solder.  I wanted to try that and see how it compares with solder paste I’ll use later.  Then I put some tack flux on top of the solder with a syringe.  Before I used the flux, I was able to blow the tiny &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; I’m using off the board with my hot air iron.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; stays on the board and remains when the flux melts, due to surface tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to watch slightly misaligned resistors get pulled into place as the solder melts and forms a fillet with the part.  Even the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOT23&lt;/span&gt;-6 ATTiny10 chip self aligned a little.  Very cool stuff.  I jumped to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; current limit resistor with my multimeter and see that the expected 14.3 mA is flowing through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt;.  (And that I mounted it the correct direction, as it lit up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the photo transistor of the board for now.  I will first get a good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; flashing “Hello World” program loaded to verify that I can program my micro controller and that it functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Mostly build Smart Domino board bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was worried that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CR2032&lt;/span&gt; battery holder would be too cheap.  But it works well enough, which is good, because I have 9 more.  Now I need to see if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; programmer for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TPI&lt;/span&gt; that I bought off eBay will work and load a tiny little flash &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; program.  I just need to get back up to speed with assembly programming in general and Atmel 8-bit assembly specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATTiny10 is a little too small of a chip (in register count and memory) to be able to efficiently handle C code.  It has 1024 bytes of program memory, which means 512 instructions with the 16-bit instruction length of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVR&lt;/span&gt; 8-bit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RISC&lt;/span&gt; micro controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/micro-domino/SmartDominoV1.png" style="width: 405px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First Smart Domino prototype board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a kick out of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://relwin.hackhut.com/2011/03/01/555-timer-contest-entry/"&gt;Le Dominoux&lt;/a&gt; project for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.555contest.com/"&gt;the 555 contest&lt;/a&gt;.
I thought about making a few to mess around with.  This would be a good project to practice some manual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; soldering skills.  I haven’t worked with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; at all.
(Yes, I know that the Le Dominoux was through hole constructed, but I planned on mine being &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I priced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt;, resistors, caps, LEDs, and 555s.  Then I wondered how cheap I could get a microcontroller.  I was surprised that the ATTiny10 was only double the price of a 555.  $0.60 vs just under $0.30.  That made my brain go off on a tangent.  I can use a photo transistor and resistor and an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; and resistor and have the full thing.  I also would have the capability to use digital or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADC&lt;/span&gt; input.  If the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADC&lt;/span&gt; input was near the upper limit, I could flash the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; as a warning that the input photo transistor is saturated and it will be impossible to detect flashes.  I could see how sampling the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADC&lt;/span&gt; and only reacting with changes would self adjust to steady ambient light.  This could start simple and get as complex as I could fit into the code space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought that I could make a programmer for the dominoes.  By exciting the photo transistor in a certain pattern, I could program each domino to have specific characteristics.  Set the delay between when it sees a signal and when it relays it to the next domino.  Set how long the light should stay on or if it should follow the previous duration.  I wonder how accurate of a tone I could reproduce with a varying frequency square wave into a piezo element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to see how fast the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; to photo transistor can switch.  Possibly I can send data between the dominoes with the actual flash.  I could see a count being useful.  Each one adds to it and passes along.  Now tone frequency could be based on count.  The possibilities are vast and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran across the DorkbotPDX pcb batch order and saw that it was going out on June 6th.  So last night I decided to throw a board together.  I went by datasheets, as I don’t have most of the parts yet but had to create custom parts for everything except the resistors and caps.  However, for under $5 I will have 3 trial boards of my Micro Domino.  Hopefully I got the circuit good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using a 2 pin header for power switch.  I also added a resistor location and “header” connection for speaker.  I can attach a piezo element here to experiment.  I also included a 2x3 header for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; programming (actually &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TPI&lt;/span&gt; on the ATTiny.)  The photo transistor will be a standard through hole style, but I will be soldering the leads sideways on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; style pads.  It looks like I messed up the collector pad, but that just goes to Vcc, so I can solder a small jumper wire for it.  A battery holder for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CR2032&lt;/span&gt; sized 3V battery is on the bottom and will be what the domino site on.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; is going to be a wide lens (120 degrees) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have then in two weeks.  Time will tell if this will work the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;3.3V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDO&lt;/span&gt; Regulator soldered to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; jack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; is a device to program an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVR&lt;/span&gt; microcontroller using a 6 pin header in a circuit.  It does not contain any capability to power the circuit being programmed.  This could be very handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Jones at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eevblog.com"&gt;EEVBlog&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/25/eevblog-158-avr-isp-mk2-lm317-regulator-tutorial"&gt;video about adding power to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; cable, using an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LM317&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide both 5V and 3.3V.  The issue with this, as he stated, was that the 5V source was very close to the required dropout voltage of the regulator to get the 3.3V.  In addition, resistors are needed to set the voltage.  This is my version of hacking on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use a Low Drop Out regulator for 3.3V.  The specific part I used was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rohm.com/products/databook/power/pdf/bdxxka5-e.pdf"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BD33KA5&lt;/span&gt; in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO252&lt;/span&gt;-3 package (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.  I started by soldering the tab of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDO&lt;/span&gt; 3.3V regulator to the shield ground on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; jack.  My new $50 Atten 858D+ hot air rework station made this much easier than an iron.  I had tried and failed with the iron before the 858D+ arrived.  According to the data sheet, I needed a 1uF on both Vcc and 3.3V output pins.  I used some tantalums that I had around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/enhancing-the-avr-isp-ii/Vcc.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Connection from the 5V pin of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; to the 3.3V voltage regulator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soldered the Vcc side of the regulator directly to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; 5V pin and also soldered a 5V wire from the regulator back to the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would use a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPDT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; switch to allow for 5V - 0V - 3.3V output options.  I used a double pole, instead of a single pole, so I could use the other pole of the switch to power little LEDs beside the 5V and 3.3V labels.  This will give an indication to make it harder to accidentally power into a live circuit.  I decided to mess with surface mount LEDs.  This would turn out to be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Powering both the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; indicators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/enhancing-the-avr-isp-ii/Snapped2.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; LEDs were too delecate for me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&amp;amp;name=475-1408-1-ND"&gt;LEDs from DigiKey&lt;/a&gt;, they were tiny.  Like, stick to your soldering iron when trying to solder tiny.  Like, Joe you are going to snap them in half a couple times.  I soldered the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; to a 1/4W resistor and a wire.  This allowed me to test the power.  For 2mA, these were pretty decent.  I snapped one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; during this, but resoldered on another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After messing around with soldering those to the switch and trying to bend the resistors into place, I snapped both of them.  I think it might have been possible with thin wire and would have looked good.  But I was done with this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; stuff for now. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/enhancing-the-avr-isp-ii/BetterLEDs.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Change to 3mm LEDs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed some 3mm red LEDs that I have had since I was in middle school.  These let me also fix the one problem I didn’t think about.  My &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMD&lt;/span&gt; LEDs were crossed, so the light would be illuminated the opposite direction of the switch toggle.  I crossed the hookup for the 3mm LEDs.  I had to change the current limiting resistors from 1.5k to 220.  I figured about 16 mA for these LEDs and it turned out about right.  (I am running the LEDs directly from the 5V power.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 5V and 3.3V soldered to each side of one pole, I wired the center down to pin 2 of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; header.  Now we can power it with 5V, 3.3V or Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connected the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; connector on an Arduino Uno board.  With no power, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; should work as normal, if you power the Uno board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/enhancing-the-avr-isp-ii/PowerOff.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Connected to Uno but with power off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then tried the 5V power to the Uno board and that looked good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/enhancing-the-avr-isp-ii/On5V.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Powering the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNO&lt;/span&gt; with 5V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; connection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I thought the Uno might run on 3.3V, even though I don’t think you are supposed to use up to 16 MHz with 3.3V.  I didn’t try programming, but the power definitely works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/enhancing-the-avr-isp-ii/On33V.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Powering the Uno with 3.3V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not terribly pleased with the results of hot gluing the LEDs.  It spreads the light too much.  If I was to do it again, I wouldn’t try to cover around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt;, I would have put a dab of hot glue and stuck the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; into the glue.  I did find out that the 858D+ rework air iron was again helpful to fix my glue mess.  By setting the temperature down to the minimum of 100 C, I was able to remelt the glue and push the LEDs in deeper with a flat screw driver, without hurting the plastic case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, it is a test device, so it doesn’t have to look good.  It just has to work.  Work it does.&lt;/p&gt;

He was the strongest man I have ever known.  It was hard to see him wither with a body not able to do what his will desired.  His suffering finally ended during the early morning of April 20th.  Despite knowing that the cancer was terminal and preparing for it.  Death is never easy.  It tears a hole through you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm was heavy.  No matter what I did, I couldn’t keep the ship from going down.  Long weekends driving down to be with Dad and doing anything I could to make him more comfortable, but the storm just grew.  The ship was groaning, in so much pain.  Then, faster than I could imagine, the ship is in splinters and I’m awash in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m drowning with the ship’s wreckage all around me.  Trying to be strong and put on a brave face for the others floating with me, but the waves of grief come fast and are towering.  I gasp for breath and hope to survive.  There is a piece of wreckage that I grab.  A physical thing or two, a picture, memories of a certain time.  But all around me is wreckage reminding me of the beauty of the ship that was and now is gone.  For a while, all I can do is float. Survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waves are shrinking.  I know they’ll be less frequent.  Some waves I’ll see coming for birthdays or while doing something we did together.  Some will surprise me, unexpectantly filling my mouth with water and making me gasp.  But I know I’ll get through them.  I know I’ll survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that Dad is now reaping his reward, for years of service to the Lord.  That makes it easier to handle.  I never knew my dad’s dad and my namesake.  He died when my father was in his late teens.  It was up to dad to teach me of grandpa through himself and now I will have the task of teaching my unborn children of dad through me.  I hope I’m worthy of that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one sure way to get dad to do something was to tell him it is impossible.  This is one of the best lessons dad taught me, that I could do anything.  I might have to learn something first and the worst that would happen is I would fail.  So what?  What happens most often is I didn’t.  In a world full of people scared to try, this was a great gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never realized how many lives dad touched.  With little notice, on a Thursday night, the largest funeral home in town was completely packed.  The line was out the door for hours.  Cars circled the lot to wait for someone to leave, just to have a spot.  A dozen times that night, someone came up to me and told me how much dad meant to them, with a story they had to tell.  So many things I never would have know he did.  Something dad probably just did from his nature and without a second thought.  Most would love to have touched that many lives when they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you, dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I hope the waves never stop.&lt;/p&gt;

As they posted &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.precentral.net/touchstone-v2-has-identity-not-nfc"&gt;in this article on the site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; confirmed the identification to work as I assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new TouchStones will use the 3.1 MHz frequency to pass a unique key to the new WebOS phones, which will enable them to know where it is docked.  You will obviously have to tell the phone where each dock is located the first time you use it.  Derek did a great job translating my geek speak into general WebOS fan digestible content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few errors with the wording in the document.  He refers to a coil for each frequency.  I believe that both frequencies will use the same coil.  It is resonant on both the communication frequency (3.1 MHz) and the charging frequency (118.5 KHz), so there is no reason to add extra hardware to the mix.  This isn’t really important to the end user, but just trying to be technically correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have speculated that this 3.1 MHz frequency will allow the TouchStone to have a data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; cable.  I don’t think this is possible.  The data rate on a 3.1 MHz carrier is very low.  The best that could be emulated is a old style serial connection (think phone line modem speeds).  Nothing even close to the speed of even &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; 1.0.  It will most likely only be a method of establishing the connection via Bluetooth for major data transfer or for a stereo audio out functionality.  Otherwise, it will just be used to exchange fairly short messages, like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; example shown during the Feb. 9th event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/webos-touchstone-now-and-future/touchstone.jpg" style="width: 115px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Palm Pre was released, Palm also sold a unique inductive charger called the Touchstone.  Inductive charging isn’t new, by any means.  Electric toothbrushes and many other devices have used them in the past.  This was a first for cell phones, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I purchased my Pre and eventually many Touchstones, I didn’t have a good oscilloscope to play around with the signals.  Now I do.  With the announcement of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;’s new phones and an expansion of the TouchStone coil functionality in the phone, I thought I would take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should start will a little explanation of Touchstone charging.  The charger is a base with a coil embedded in it.  The phone also has a coil embedded into the back.  In addition, both have magnets to align the phone and base coils together.  You slide the phone onto the Touchstone and the magnets pull it to the correct spot for alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transformer is a set of two coils, used to transfer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; signals from one side to the other.  They are most commonly used to reduce household voltages for use by devices (after rectification of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; signal into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;).  The transformer is the largest component in the big “wall wart plug” power supplies, supplied with so many electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformers are also used for isolation.  Since only a changing magnetic field can induce a current in a wire, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; cannot be passed through a transformer.  This is useful when a circuit had a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; bias, along with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; signal, and you only want the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; signal.  On a computer modem, you usually see a transformer used to interface with the phone line and isolate the delicate circuitry from a line that can have fairly high voltage on it.  So they can be used for signals, not just power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side of the transformer that provides the power is called the primary, the coil in the Touchstone in this case.  The receiving coil of the transformer is the secondary, the WebOS phone’s back.  Since the Touchstone is powered by 5V 1A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; plug, it has its own oscillator to make a varying signal to drive the coil.  But what does this signal look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a simple two coil wire antenna around the base of my Touchstone, where it meets the Pre.  This is acting as another secondary for the transformer.  The voltage induced into the coil is proportional to the number of turns, so my coil has a very low voltage.  However, the scope has enough sensitivity to sample the frequency and waveform characteristics of this small signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 320px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/webos-touchstone-now-and-future/touchstone-scope.png" style="width: 320px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Screen capture of my scope displaying the waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Displayed on the upper right is the waveform frequency, which varied between 121-123 KHz.  This is a higher frequency than I expected, as I remember that losses go up in transformers with frequency.  I am not a radio frequency engineer, so I am sure they figured out that this frequency is best (and/or was a location on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RF&lt;/span&gt; band for which they could get permission from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; to operate.) Without having iron cores of typical power transformers, it must be more efficient to transfer power at these higher frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I started looking at this were the frequencies from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; report, tweeted about by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/webosinternals"&gt;@WebOSInternals&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Veer’s Touchstone back has a receive frequency of 118.5 KHz and a transmit frequency of 3.1 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought neither of these would be charging frequencies, as they both seem fairly high.  I was wrong.  With the analysis of the original Touchstone, it is obvious that the 118.5 KHz is the charging frequency of the new Touchstones.  This is close enough in frequency that old WebOS phones will charge on new Touchstones and new WebOS phones will charge on old Touchstones.  (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;’s presentation on the 9th actually showed a new device on an old Palm branded Touchstone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In radio antennas, there is a property call resonance.  This is where the antenna is tuned such that the maximum amount of power is transferred to the antenna.  Otherwise, energy is just lost in the circuitry before the antenna and the transmission power is lower than it could have been.  Antennas resonate at multiples of a given frequency.  So a coil antenna that is tuned to resonate at 118.5 KHz would also resonate at 26 times that frequency or 3.08 MHz.  Now we know why these specific two frequencies were selected and why the Touchstone charging frequency has changed slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is unknown is if new Touchstones will use the 3.1 MHz to communicate with the new devices.  It would be a method of identifying exactly which Touchstone you are on if they told the phone a unique &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;.  This would be a great way for the phone to have different functionality at different locations, in the new exhibition mode.  What is known is that new devices communicate with each other via the 3.1 MHz frequency over each device’s Touchstone charging coil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to put a new device and Touchstone on the scope and see what the data looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

It is byte based, which makes it safe from big-endian and little-endian translations.  Somewhere when reading about how torrents worked, I got looking at their file format.
As far as I know, the Bencode format isn’t used on anything but torrent files.  The format is pretty simple, with only 4 different data structures: Byte String, Integer, List, and Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bencode-basics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bencode Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="byte-string"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Byte String&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is formatted as [integer length]:[byte string].  Simply read the length number of bytes following the colon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="integer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integer type is structured as i[contents]e. Contents can be positive or negative integer, without leading zeros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid examples: i-1234e i1234e&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="list"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list type (or array if you like) is formatted as l[contents]e.  Contents will be any valid Bencode types just appended together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dictionary"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dictionary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dictionary type (also know as a hash or an associative array) is formatted as d[contents]e.  Contents includes [key][value] pairs until termination.  The key value must always be a byte string, but the value may be any Bencode type (even another dictionary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to store complex structures with these simple types.  I enjoyed learning the format by creating a Python class for encoding and decoding data in Bencode format.
The source code for this class is available &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sacherjj/bencode"&gt;on my github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Python for quite a while as a scripting language, but only recently started trying to create proper classes and develop more advanced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OO&lt;/span&gt; designed applications with Python.  I’m sure this isn’t purely Pythonic and would welcome any criticism and ways to improve.
I wanted to call out a few things in the code that were good learning experiences for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="encoding-methods"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encoding Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions are objects in Python and can be stored and referenced just like data.  In the internal encoding function _local_encode, I’m storing the various data type encode methods in a
dictonary with data type string as key.  This allows me to get data type string with &lt;code&gt;type(data).__name__&lt;/code&gt;.  If the key exists in the dictonary, I envoke that method to process the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_local_encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Returns the proper Bencoded string for data given """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;encoders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dict'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'tuple'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'str'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'int'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'float'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;encoders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;encoders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Encoder is not defined for data type: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;String encoding is very simple, just joining length of the string with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@staticmethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_encode_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Converts string to Bencoded Byte String """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encoding integer is just wrapping ‘i’ and ‘e’ around the string conversion of the integer.  Since bencode does not encode floats, those are converted to ints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@staticmethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_encode_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Converts Integer to Bencoded Integer string """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;e'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_encode_float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Converts Float to Bencoded Integer string """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List encoding performs recursive calls into _local_encode as it loops through the list, just appending items.  I optimised with lists instead of string concatenation.  Originally, I built this with the ben variable as a string and += calls, which is terrible for memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_encode_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Converts List or Tuple to Bencoded List string """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'l'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_local_encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'e'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictionary works the same way as list, just appending the generated values from _local_encode with the addition of a string in front.  Again, this was changed from string concatenation to list append.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_encode_dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Converts Dictionary to Bencoded Dictionary String """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_encode_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_local_encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'e'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came out simpler and cleaner than I expected for encoding.  But it is a really simple format, so it shouldn’t be too complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="decoding-methods"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decoding Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my external decode method, I’m using a class level pointer for the bencoded string and walking through it.  I setup those two variables and call into _local_decode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Returns the data structure defined by the Bencoded string """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ben_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ben_string&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_local_decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;IndexError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Index Error at Pointer = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ben_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I thought I might use the dictonary mapped methods again, I couldn’t find a clean way to handle the 11 possible cases for integer.  So, I decided to just just go old school flow control.  This is one situation that I would have used a switch statement with an else case if it was available in Python.  If you have a more Pythonic way of doing this, please ley me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_local_decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;""" Detects and returns the proper Bencoded data type starting at current Pointer position """&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ben_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'i'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'l'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_parse_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_parse_dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'-'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'4'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'5'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'6'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'7'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'8'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'9'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_parse_byte_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Invalid character detected at position &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cur_char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into Integer and String decoding, we have a helper function.  Both the Integer and the String will have a certain number of characters to parse into an integer.
The only difference is the stop character.  For the String, this is the length of the string with ‘:’ end character.  For the Integer, this is the actual data value with ‘e’ end character.
You will see this method called from both decode methods.  Note that the int() parsing handles the leading ‘-‘ fine for negative integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_get_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end_char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Returns number in string up to termination character given.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    """&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;start_pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ben_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end_char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ben_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Parse int&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Consume the end_char&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only job of the integer decode method is to consume the leading character that doesn’t exist in the string integer.  Then all the work is turned over to the _get_number method above up to the ‘e’ character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_parse_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Parses a Bencoded Integer type of format i&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;e&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'e'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The String decoding gets the length integer this the helper function up to the ‘:’ character.  Then it gets the string for return, and increments the pointer past the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_parse_byte_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Parses a Bencoded Byte String type of format &amp;lt;len&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;byte string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    """&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;str_len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_get_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;':'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;byte_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ben_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;str_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;str_len&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Consume the byte string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;byte_string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list starts with ‘l’ and ends with ‘e’.  So we move the pointer to consume the ‘l’, then we loop until the current pointer character is an ‘e’.  Each time through the while,
the class level pointer might increment quite a bit, as data items are consumed.  However, we are not at the end of the list until we see a letter ‘e’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each list item, much like the recursive encoding, we call _local_decode to return us whatever the data is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the responsibility of all the decoding methods to consume their bytes, we increment the pointer to move past the list termination ‘e’ at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_parse_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very similar to list processing, with the addition of the key.  We know that the key is required to be a byte string, so we call directly to that method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_parse_dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

We both worked through passing the 5 words per minute Morse Code and test to get our Novice license and then studied and passed the test for Technician Class.  I was licensed in 1990 and expired in 2000.  Just when I was starting work in the “Real World”, outside of college.  I didn’t bother renewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thread on a board I frequent about members who were HAMs (a nickname for Amateur Radio Operators) made me think it might be fun to get my license again.  A test was being given in Franklin on the 18th
(after the monthly meeting of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.midstatehams.org/index.html"&gt;Mid-State Amateur Radio Club&lt;/a&gt;).  I decided to go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classes used to be Novice, Technician, General, Advanced, and Extra.  And they required Morse Code (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CW&lt;/span&gt;).  Now the classes have been simplified to Technician, General and Extra.  Code is no longer needed for any of the classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have too much time to study, but I went anyway.  A large portion is electronics, so I hoped the Electrical Engineering degree would we worth something for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I knew every answer.  And it turned out that I did.  100%.  Then they mentioned that you can take the next level test for free, because you had already paid the $15 exam fee for the day.  Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Class exam was also 35 questions and I didn’t get all of them correct.  But I did get enough to pass.  Surprise.  “Do you want to take the Extra Class exam?” they asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Extra had 50 questions and asked about many regulations of which I had no clue.  I also tried to pull the knowledge of reactive power and polar coordinate description of complex power out of my mind’s archives.  I missed 19.  You had to miss only 13 to pass.  I didn’t think it was going to be that close.  It really would have been crazy to get through all the possible exams in one day, without studying much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week, I should be in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; database as a General Class Licensee.  Now I feel like I should go ahead and take the Extra Class test with some studying.  Why not do it before I really learn my new call sign?  Then I don’t have to worry about it every changing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder when the next test is going to be…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Warning: An Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids. Yes, it sounds weird. I don’t understand how they made it through marketing. I don’t think they had any type of focus group for these. I have a rule that I will try anything once, as long as there isn’t a high likelihood of death. I think this is why blowfish is so expensive, for the malpractice insurance for those that die after eating it. I don’t plan on trying blowfish any time soon. But I’m game for Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me see if I can take you through it. You pop this mint in your mouth pretty quick. See this isn’t an M&amp;amp;M. it will melt in your hand. So you have to pop it in quick.  And if you wait too long, you might just lose your nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first flavor that you get is dark chocolate. Some people like dark chocolate, but I prefer milk chocolate. So I’m dealing with the chocolate when the other flavors start. Imagine that your are eating the most over-spiced pumpkin pie that you have ever tasted… but it is covered in dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was mildly strange. After some time, the chocolate has been sucked off and you are just sucking on a piece of pumpkin pie. Well sort of. But you have been desensitized to the spice, so it seems a little like pumpkin pie. But something is hiding there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat starts to pour in. It makes sense. I had forgotten that these were Altoids. And they are curiously strong. I should have expected this. So the heat is building and I feel like I am eating a super hot radish. That is covered in ginger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after you have had an Altoids, your breath is usually fresh. It has to be, because you have burned off a the top four layers of skin in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is different. My breath smells worse. It is actually making me gag. A breath mint shouldn’t make your breath worse. My breath is like I left a pumkin pie in a hot car all day. A really old car. With a gym bag. Really bad breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it should have been a clue when Julie put out the Altoids tin. She said that she tried a few and wasn’t sure about how they taste. They are now available for others to sample. I should have seen something there, because you protect the Altoids. You make sure that no one is around and sneak one out quick and then hide it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, if you are offered a Dark Chocolate Dipped Ginger Altoids, try one. It is an experience. Maybe not a good one, but good lives are chains of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please get a real mint before you come around me to breathe all your pumpkin pie breath on me.&lt;/p&gt;

Although, reading through the article I realized that had I been in that situation, things would have gone differently.  Amy and I are a little different than the two in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident started with a man concealing his $12,000 engagement ring in a helium balloon, with the idea of actually ‘popping’ the question.  I don’t understand why he had not attached the balloon to something of a greater weight than the buoyancy.  Long story short, his plans of proposing went up, up, and away with the ring.  After following it for a couple miles in the car, he lost the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thoughts came to mind after reading this.  First, I don’t remember a balloon clause in the Scheduled Insurance coverage I purchased to cover the ring I gave Amy.  Would you be able to file a claim for it as if you just lost it?  If you didn’t have some type of insurance on a $12k ring, you are a moron.  Of course, if you let said ring fly off in a balloon you could also be classified a moron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a quote from the article.  “But I had to tell her the story — she went absolutely mad. Now she is refusing to speak to me until I get her a new ring.”  All I think of is what a materialistic little brat she sounds like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the woman I hoped to propose to would no longer talk to me until I bought her another $12,000 ring, after losing the first, I would chock it up to a cheap lesson.  For $12,000, I would have found out her true nature and start running (not walking) away.  It would save much bigger losses in the future, both emotionally and monetarily.  Perhaps she was just mad that he didn’t get a big enough ring to keep the balloon from flying away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this happened to me, Amy and I would share the sad laughter of the futility of the situation.  I know at first I would probably tell her that she would have to work for her ring, then point to the balloon quickly gaining altitude and tell her it is in there.  But I deal with stress by using humor.   She would say yes anyway and I would go buy a duplicate ring in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CZ&lt;/span&gt; until I could replace it with a real diamond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can I say, I think Amy is a better person than the woman in the article.  That is why I picked her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The ring on her finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 24th, 2004, I met Amy for the first time on our date at Acapulco Joe’s in Downtown Indianapolis. Amy’s car broke down just before we met, so she was driving her dad’s old Ford Ranger. We have been seeing each other since. On Feb 26th, we were going to reach an obscure and geeky anniversary. We will have known each other for exactly 30,000 hours. About two months ago, I targeted this date for something I had been planning for almost a year. She said, “Yes.” I’m now engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I’ve been very careful with how I didn’t give away surprises, while knowing I was giving them away. I knew I would need Amy to know my “tell”. The latest was my response to her asking if I had her favorite pizza place make a heart shaped pizza for Valentine’s Day. This was after I told her a food place was going to make dinner in a way they didn’t think about till I asked if they could. I kind of looked away and gave her a “no comment”, when she asked if I was having a pizza made in a heart. When the heart shaped pizza showed up, she already knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told Amy to reserve February 26th as a date night, she didn’t think anything of it. She didn’t know of any special date or anniversary for the 26th. Amy immediately tried to figure out what we were doing, but I gave no clues. After many days, she came across the idea of going out for a play or a movie. Here my months of “giving away” my secret plans had come into play. I “gave away” that I had no comment about that. Amy bought it hook, line and sinker. Now, I just had many things to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important piece was getting insurance for and picking up the ring. Without that, nothing happens. Since I work at an insurance company, I consulted some co-workers for best ideas about getting coverage for this ring. It wasn’t a cheap ring and would really hurt to lose it, damage it, have it stolen, etc. With all of those details taken care of, I picked up the ring in early February. I had to bring it to work on the day I picked it up, because of the way the timing worked out. I told the co-worker who helped with insurance advice that I had picked it up. She asked to see it. I said, “No. Men have died for less than showing someone an engagement before she gets it.” After thinking about it, she agreed. When I got home, I had to find a good hiding place. Just knowing that the ring was sitting there and I couldn’t say anything was tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started preparations and tried to keep them secret. I was on a time crunch for making the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; and would up letting Amy know about it, just playing it off as a fun scavenger hunt to start the date. I didn’t finish it until the night before the “date.” It was really dorky, but I thought she would get a kick out if it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole night was almost blown as we left work, a day before the big event. A co-worker who knew about my plans yelled, “Good Luck Joe!” I reacted with a quieter, “Its not tonight.” Then I shut up and hoped Amy didn’t hear anything. I learned later that she did, just didn’t think it was for anything special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day was here and I gave Amy a note at 5:20, then left in her truck. It isn’t running very well and took some will power to get to the destination. She now drives a Passat and I use the truck when we need to haul things a short distance. The front of the note indicated that it shouldn’t be opened till 5:30. Then the note told Amy to get in my car (which I left in the driveway) and start it at exactly 5:40. By that time, I was almost to the restaurant. The parking spot I was looking for and hoping to be empty was empty. It is an important spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amy Cox, this is your mission should you chose to accept it.” That audio greeted Amy as she started the car. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; consisted of me being a dork and Mission Impossible music, with directions. At a few places where the timing was unknown, I had her skip to the next track once she reached various places. I figured that she would know where she was heading about half way there. It didn’t really matter if she found out. I had more planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thought about standing outside, right were I was waiting for her on our first date. I decided not to for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She would wonder why and possibly think it was a really special day (we couldn’t have that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COLD&lt;/span&gt;. I was willing to do it if I had not thought of #1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy arrived a little after 6 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. I was sitting in the same booth we sat on our first date. This wasn’t an accident. I had come previously and made sure to have it reserved. However, I had done this once before on the anniversary of our first date, so nothing to shockingly new yet. After all, this was the 26th, not the 24th, and February, not September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner was nice. We chatted and Amy couldn’t figure out something special was going on. All according to plan. After dinner we ordered dessert. We had never eaten dessert at Acapulco Joe’s. Cheesecake was odd for a Mexican Restaurant, but the fried ice-cream felt at home. Amy took the cherry, but gave me the stem. I like seeing how fast I can tie them into a knot with my tongue. When we left the table, I slipped the tied stem into my pocket for something cheesy later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During dinner, Amy asked what I had to haul in the truck, because that was the reason I told her I was taking it. I wouldn’t tell. She worried that it was sitting in the back of the truck to be stolen. I told her that it fit in the cab. This made her ask why I didn’t just take the car. To that I said nothing and changed the subject. I couldn’t tell her that the cargo I was carrying in the truck was the most expensive thing that truck has ever carried. It wasn’t sitting in the truck, it was in my coat pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left at 6:54 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. I told Amy that the rest of the night required the truck and we walked towards it. While crossing the street Amy mentioned, “Its funny. I drove the truck here on our first date and you drove the Maxima.” I resisted the urge to reply quickly and acted out my best thinking look for 10 seconds. Then I replied, “I guess so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked up the sidewalk towards the truck. When she spotted it, she said “That is about were I parked, too.” It was actually exactly where she parked. The last spot before the hydrant. “Really?” was all I said. I told her she needed to get in the truck, but she couldn’t find her keys in her purse. I opened the door for her. As she started to get in the truck I told her to turn around. I got down on one knee and said some of the things that I had written down throughout the week. I was nervous and don’t remember exactly what I said. The only part that I can really remember is that it was exactly 30,000 hours since we first met and I’ve loved spending a majority of those hours since then with her. I should have had the camera ready to capture her face when she realized what was going on. I placed the ring on her finger and she just stared at it. I let her enjoy it for a while before reaching in my pocket to get something to put in the box. Then I gave her the closed box and told her that wasn’t all. She opened the box and I said, “Here is the knot I tied on the night I asked you to tie the knot.” Cheezy, but she laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that she thought we were going to see a movie or play tonight, so I gave her the option of going to see a movie. She said that she didn’t know, but that sounded good. As we were walking to the truck, Amy had mentioned how cold it was. I offered to drive her back to the car in the truck. She mentioned that she didn’t feel cold any more. I just walked her back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were to meet up just south of 465, then get in the car for the rest of the way. When I almost got there, my cell phone rang. It was Amy. She called her mom on the way home and was on auto pilot. She was almost home, instead of heading to where we were supposed to meet. I’m guessing shock was involved. She told me that she probably couldn’t stay still for a movie and wanted to tell everyone. I thought that would be the case, but she told me she wanted to go. I started driving back to her house. Amy spent the rest of the night and all day at work showing everyone her ring. I was glad that I was finally out of the “When you giving her a ring?” question. I didn’t know that it was immediately replaced with another question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You two set a date yet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: We were married on June 6th, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

I have heard for people using unglazed tiles from a hardware store, but I am concerned with impurities that may come out of those tiles if I pick the incorrect one.  I have purchased a thick stone, but it eventually cracked after some use , but no mis-use from me.  I’m currently using a large round stone from Pampered Chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick for a great crust is to get the pizza into a hot oven onto a hot stone.   By hot oven, I mean as hot as your oven will go hot.  Mine is 500.  If you can get 550, all the better.  Get the stone in there and preheat at least 30 minutes.  This gets the stone as hot as the oven.  The stone makes the bottom crisp, with a nice soft center.  To get the pizza in the oven, you use a device called a pizza peel.  I made the mistake of getting two of the cheap wooden peels.  These are fine for getting the pizza into the oven, but tougher to get the pizza out.  I would recommend jumping immediately to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBSSM0?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=joesacher-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000VBSSM0"&gt;aluminum peels&lt;/a&gt;.  My wooden peels go unused now.  The thinness of the aluminum makes a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the dough is ready, it doesn’t really matter if you roll out the dough or hand toss.  I like keeping a little thicker edge on the dough to give you a breadstick to eat after you finish the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To slide a pizza into the oven, you need some ball bearings.  Flour or corn meal are common.  I prefer cornmeal.  Sprinkle a little on the peel over the area that the pizza will cover.  It makes the most sense to position the pizza as close to the front edge as possible.  Shake the peel and make sure that the pizza dough moves around easily.  Now make the pizza as quick as possible.  The cornmeal will take moisture from the dough and will start to stick.  Before trying to put the pizza in the oven, do another shake test.  If it doesn’t move, you didn’t use enough corn meal.  Get under the dough with a spatula or turner and sling some more cornmeal in there.  You want to find out now, not when you are shaking the toppings onto the hot stone, with no pizza dough.  It is better to error on the side of too much corn meal at first.  However, the corn meal will burn when left on the stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not try to get the pizza off with a quick jerk.  This will also distribute toppings onto the stone.  Put the peel in the oven at a 25 to 30 degree angle and touch down on the stone where the edge of the pizza should go.  With small easy shakes, ease the pizza onto the stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the pizza out is where the aluminum peel really shines.  It is 1/8th the thickness of a wood peel.  The allows you to slide the peel under the pizza without kicking the pizza off the back of the stone and into the back of the oven,  This makes a lot of mess and a lot of smoke.  Getting the pizza out is where you want a quick action.  If you did everything right, the pizza should not be attached to the stone at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it all goes wrong.  Well, I’ve found a long metal turner made for outside grilling very handy.  If you pizza sticks at all, you can scrape it off with this turner.  It also help clean all the cheese that is on the stone from where you put on too much cheese and not enough corn meal and the first shake just tossed cheese and toppings onto the stone.  It is gonna happen, just have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When messing around and cleaning the stone, it is a good idea to wear some oven mitts.  I’ve managed to hit the oven rack or something a few times and a 500-550 degree oven makes burns happen fast.&lt;/p&gt;

I could not find many that had used both, to get an idea of the differences between them. Now owning a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; Turncrafter Pro and having taken a class and used a Jet Mini for 5 hours or so, I decided to summarize the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both lathes look deceptively similar. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; is 4” longer in the bed at 18”, vs 14” for the Jet. The Jet also has one higher speed. The first 5 speed ranges seem to be very close. The beds look almost exactly the same, as do the banjo and steady rest. The motor height adjustment is almost exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality wise, the Jet has a nicer finish and features. By this, I mean the machining is a little better cleaned up and parts are more thought out. The threads on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; headstock looked like there were cut and never touched again. There are burrs and sharp edges that I will be dressing down. While the Jet lathe I was using had been in use at the classroom for a while, I haven”t noticed this on Jet minis out on display at shops either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major difference, which will affect daily use, are the belt access doors. The Jet has a nice flip open door for both top and bottom access. Although the spring handle setup for the bottom door seems a little strange to me, it works fast once you get used to it. The access to the belts are in exactly the same spot, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; has a thumb screw to undo and then a little plastic piece which is lifted and removed. This piece has slits on the bottom that sits on bolts screwed in below the opening. The piece would be set down for the change then replaced. It makes for a piece to lose and takes over twice as long to change the belt speed as on the Jet. I will be replacing my plastic pieces with doors that have a spring clip, similar to the Jet’s. Currently my access panels are off, because they are annoying to remove and replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locking handle on the steady rest and the tail stock depth lock are both a plastic handles on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;. The operation is the same, both spring loaded handles which can be lifted to change position. The plastic handles don’t feel flimsy, but I doubt they will last quite as long as the metal handles on the Jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point to point, my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; is slightly off (1/32” tail is closer to me than the head point).  While a thin shim under the tail will fix this, I”m not sure if this is typical with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; or not. My sample size is 1. I did not see this with the 4 Jet lathes I looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still happy with my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt; purchase. After I spend a little bit of time to polish off some of the rough edges and I will have a nice lathe for about $100 less than the Jet. I don’t see the loss of the high end (3800 rpm or so) on the Jet as too much of a problem. 3200 rpm is fast enough and both have the 500 rpm low end. But there is no doubt, the Jet is a better finished machine, with a few upgrades over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;. If I could have found the Jet on special for within $20-40 of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;, I would have paid the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to give it a read before the movie came out.  If you haven’t read it yet and plan to see the movie, don’t read it until after the movie.  It will ruin the movie for you.  Not in how much it gives away of the movie, but in how much the movie doesn’t give you anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers will follow for both the book and movie.  If you are interested in either, just bookmark this and come back after you have read/seen one or both.  You are warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been a big fan of the horror genre, because they just always seem silly to me.  I am Legend is in some parts silly as well.  It is a decent popcorn movie, but not much more.  The times where I wished it would follow some of the inspired twists in the book, but I was disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Legend opens with newscast audio playing over the traditional logos.  Video cuts to some doctor, played by Emma Thompson, discussing a new method of battling cancer: a mutating virus.  It is odd that she isn’t happier about discussing this discovery.  You wonder if the director was trying to foreshadow or just let the viewer guess that the doctor knows there are problems with her magic solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then cut to 3 years later with overgrown vegetation filled New York City and Will Smith’s character tearing down streets in a Mustang.  Here the movie starts straying from the book and from believability.  Robert Neville of the book realized that he was on his own.  If he got hurt, he would die.  Robert Neville of the movie (Will Smith) seems happy speeding through town, dodging parked cars, armored personnel carriers, and other cement and steel objects to hunt deer at 50 mph.  I don’t see that happening in a place where if you crash a car badly, you die.  There are no paramedics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the book was the growth of Neville as he learned to survive and learned about the infected.  He traveled to the library to learn about bacteria and microscopes and how to investigate the situation.  The “monsters” were two types of vampires: the infected living and the dead reanimated.  The dead were more like traditional zombies and the living were intelligent and capable of learning.  They did not possess super human strength and were feared because of their numbers, not power and intelligence.  Neville’s location was not a secret and they haunted and taunted him outside his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the movie involves Neville living in a classy, well decorated home.  He has generators under the counter. (I guess he pumps the exhaust outside.)  With a future where electricity is hard to come by, Neville does his research in the basement, using technical toys that would be annoying even in modern day.  He video logs his research with a lipstick camera eyeglasses, just to record pass and fail on test subjects.  All recorded to 6 backup hard drives.  Seriously, how hard is paper and pen?  It isn’t like hard drives are good backups when they are all stacked on top of each other to be destroyed in a fire.  Run a low power copier and distribute the paper copies a few places.  I guess that wouldn’t be visual and flashy.  it would just be a smart use of limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monsters in the movie are super-human terrors.  Once they find out where Neville lives, his steel shuttered residence with stadium lights and perimeter explosives, is no match for the creatures who just tear through thick plastered walls and ceilings.  The make up effects and probably tons of computer effects made the infected into scary, bestial creatures.  What made them interesting in the book was their human qualities.  I was glad that this wasn’t a gore fest, but it might as well have been.  Any qualities that existed in the book that made it more intelligent than a standard horror fare were almost gone in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have been other adaptations of the book, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058700/"&gt;The Last Man on Earth (1964)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067525/"&gt;The Omega Man (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, none have come close to capturing the book.  Matheson was involved with Last Man on Earth, until the script was changed and he asked for his name to be removed from the film.  I guess I have a naive belief that if a movie takes a books title, it should bear some semblance to the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie is saved somewhat with the fine acting of Smith, but is nothing more than a popcorn action flick.  The cinematography showed some beautiful vistas of post apocalyptic New York, but lacked inspiration at times.  One high point in visuals involved infected dogs wanting to attack Neville, held at bay by a slowly shrinking line of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Neville of the film is a much more interesting person &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEFORE&lt;/span&gt; the virus hits, but not near so much after.  In fact, it falls into the movie cliché of one of the few people that can fix the problem being on of the ones that is left to fix it.  He is obviously important, being a possibly savior from the virus and on the cover of Time magazine.  If it is explained how one of possible 10,000 in the world that could find the cure, is somehow immune to the virus, I missed it.  In contrast, Neville of the book is the average man that just happens to be immune.  Any knowledge he has to learn for beating the virus (or bacteria in the book) is hard won.  He is a person with many faults.  He drinks too much.  He isn’t nice.  Not a Hollywood hero.  He is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I have with the film adaptation is the perversion of the title: I am Legend.  It has lost the sad irony of the book.  Neville is not a legend among the infected, to be dealt with.  He becomes a legend among the survivors.  In the book, Neville determines the bacterium that causes the infection.  He doesn’t realize that the living infected have created a drug which allows them to deal with the effects.  They have formed society.  Neville has become a legend by killing the infected when they rest, during the day.   He is feared as the last old style human.  He is captured by the new society and sentenced to death.  The kicker is that he is infiltrated by an infected agent, an infected woman acting as a human.  This is what made seeing the woman and boy in the film, with no twist, so frustrating.  In the film, Neville finds a cure and proceeds to die in heroic Hollywood fashion, passing the cure on to save the few humans left.  Hurrah, hope for survivors.  It seems that irony is not a good enough ending.  Everyone must be happy when they leave the theater, even if the ending stinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading books about writing fiction, I was recently exposed to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina"&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/a&gt;, a latin phrase meaning literally “god out of a machine.”  It is often used to describe when the resolution of the story just happens without proper setup or reason.  It is talked about often, because the audience needs to believe in the motivation of the characters to not lose their suspension of disbelief.  The ending to the film is just a very bad example of deus ex machina.  It helps make a mediocre movie only more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Legend has enough special effects to do well at the box office, but why does film have to be dumbed down this much for people to consume it?  I might have to read the book again to get this bad taste out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I realized that my recumbent would allow me to complete my dream of riding a bicycle across the country, I started research all over the web.  While reading through the many trip reports of coast to coast touring cyclists, two things became clear.  First, I would be riding the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/transamerica.cfm"&gt;TransAmerica trail&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adventurecycling.org"&gt;Adventure Cycling&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 (the year of my birth).  Second, I should purchase, read, re-read, and take along Donna’s book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read through Donna’s book at least once.  It is divided into 82 days worth of riding to cross the country, so I often will read a few of the day accounts at a time.  Normally I read sections to compare and contrast them with other on-line travelogues, jotting notes in the book.  Each day has a literary description of the ride, followed with turn by turn directions and points of interest.  This book was published in 1996, so you should not take it as gospel that “Joe Blowe’s Convienient Mart” will still be there.  As an adventure cyclist, you wouldn’t always want to know, would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book can get you across the country without a problem, however, you should use it along with the excellent &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; provided by Adventure Cycling.  These maps are a cyclist dream, without all of the pitfalls contained in standard road maps.  Do you wonder which of the nearest towns have a bike shop, or a post office, or a laundry mat?  It’s on the map.  The many Adventure Cycling trips across the country every year keep the maps as up to date as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m left in May of 2002, with this book in my bag, to spend &lt;a class="reference external" href='http://www.joesacher.com/category/trans-am.html'&gt;4 months riding across this great country of ours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When are you leaving?&lt;/p&gt;

I have a cooking problem.  Me cooking, itself isn’t a problem.  I have a problem following recipes.  This is something I learned from my Mom.  To make a dish, you need to look at a half dozen recipes on the subject, then go in the kitchen and cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister, Ruth, is the exact opposite.  She prefers the nice guide of a recipe.  Some of Mom’s recipes that I will post on this site were translated by Ruth from watching Mom make them.  I’ve often told my Mom that she needs to keep a kitchen lab book.  There are times that a dish is just superb.  We enjoy it, because we know there is no chance of recreating it.  Even Mom didn’t know exactly what she did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to attempt to keep track of my successful experiments on this site.  It will be a lab notebook for all to see and an easy place that I can reference again when I want to make the same type of dish.  These experiments won’t be as detailed as a recipe.  Just a log of what I did to make the dish.  Hopefully it will allow recreation of the experiments that “work”.  We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/loadedrocket.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;I’ll be describing the construction of the gray panniers located directly under my seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find a pannier set that works exactly as I would like for the under-seat rack on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.   I like the panniers made by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.panniers.com"&gt;Arkel&lt;/a&gt; of all the panniers I have looked at and used.  However, it was impossible to find a size that worked exactly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make my own set tailored (quite literally) exactly to my needs and I borrowed quite a bit from Arkel’s design work.  Below is a description of the process for those who would like to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bicycle panniers are designed for normal upright bicycles.  Good panniers have been designed to never contact the rider’s feet.  At the very least this interference would be annoying.  At the worst, it could cause an accident.  It is very important to check clearance in all odd positions you can encounter on your bicycle, as frame locations and distances vary with every bicycle.  Does a fully turned front fork with the foot forward catch, etc.  Since I am designing a bag for use under my seat on a recumbent, foot strike issues are not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/WholeSetup.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dining room table pannier production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first debated tapering the bottom of the bag.  I couldn’t come up with a reason to do that.  My previous panniers for the under-seat rack were Arkel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;-30’s.  These are normally used as front panniers and are tall and skinny.  My biggest problem with using them on the under-seat rack is the occasional dragging while turning at faster speeds (i.e. using more lean).  I also wanted quite a bit more storage under the seat, to get as much weight low and forward as possible.  A rectangular design will be the absolute easiest shape I can build.  It also will be an efficient use of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lessons Learned: It might have been a little better to design the bag such that the bottom is level with the ground in the riding position.  Notice in the first picture above that the portion of the pannier towards the rear is lower than the front.  If I gave the pannier a little more height in the front and less in the back, I would have a slightly more optimized design for this cycle, without the bag ground strike issues I will talk about later in this article.  Keep factors like that in mind as you design your custom bag.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mocked up a pannier using a corrugated plastic back plate and paper, to check the size and clearance when the bike was leaned over to 45 degrees.  I should never get that far over while turning, but it gives me a decent safety factor.  I decided on a size of 18” long, 12.25” tall, and ~6” deep.  The zipper sections have the most seams and allowances, so I wasn’t sure what the exact final depth would be.  I planned on using a 1/2” allowance seams for everything, except for the specialized seams on the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how much time I saved by spending the hour making the mock up. It does wonders in increase your confidence about actually creating this thing.  I was able to finalize mounting hardware location as well, eliminating putting holes through the fabric in the wrong place with the final bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lessons Learned: Again on the issue of ground strike.  When measuring that 45 degree clearance, give a generous 3-4” buffer from the ground.  This is to take into account that the bag &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; sag under weight and more than you think.  Well at least more than I thought, but you might be smarter than me.  (Hopefully you are after reading this!)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="construction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased most of my raw materials from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.therainshed.com/"&gt;The Rain Shed&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good source for outdoor patterns and fabrics.  I would recommend anyone starting out making outdoor equipment to pick up Sew and Repair Your Outdoor Gear by Louise Lindgren.  I ordered it along with my fabric from the Rain Shed and it was easily worth the $17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/HeatSeal.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Using a cheap soldering iron to melt the threads together at the edge where the fabric was cut, to prevent unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using a 1000 Denier Cordura for the main fabric of the pannier.  The Cordura I used is the gray fabric in the pictures.   I need 4 pieces of fabric for the main body of the pannier:  The front of the pannier (which I define as the side facing away from the bike), the back and bottom, and the two pieces that make up the sides and top.  Both of the side and top pieces run parallel with each other, with a zipper in between them.  All this should make more sense as you start to see pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with the side/top pieces, because they would take up most of the width of the fabric.  I wanted the strength of the fabric (the warp) to be along the short dimension of the pieces, so they have to be cut with the long axis parallel to the weft.  (Warp are the threads running the length of the fabric, Weft are those running “back and forth”.)    The dimensions for my two side pieces are 7.5” x 44” and 1.5” x 44”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 325px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SmallSideZipper.jpg" style="width: 325px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side zipper seams from the outside, indicated in red.  Notice first seam is inside the fold and second seam secures the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that the most important things to do with synthetics after cutting is heat sealing.    You don’t want you bags to unravel during use and scatter all of my contents across the road!  For most thin synthetics, you can use a good hot knife for both cutting and sealing.  While I’ve used a hot knife for thin nylon, I would guess that it would be hard to cut fabric this thick  without leaving a large hard edge of melted nylon.  I used a cheap soldering iron for sealing the edges of the Cordura, after cutting out with very sharp sewing scissors.  This didn’t leave hard edges, but secured the fibers well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYK&lt;/span&gt; size 10 coil zipper for the pannier.  The size 10 is about the largest you can get and should wear very well.  The coil zipper will run around the curves of the pannier much better than a toothed zipper and the strengths are about equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 333px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SmallSideZipperBack.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side zipper seams from the inside, indicated in red.  Notice the fabric just sticking out past teh zipper from the first seam, before the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the small side piece.  The first seam is stitched with the wrong side of the zipper and fabric out.  I used a zipper foot to stitch along the zipper, leaving enough room for the large sliders.  After the first seam was finished, I pulled the fabric back, so the right side was facing up and stitched the second seam using the regular foot against the zipper (the spacing worked out just right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the pictures, you can see the two seams indicated with red lines.  The first image is from the right side of the zipper and the second from the wrong side.  Just above the red lines in the wrong side picture, you can see a little of the folded over fabric sticking out.  I tried to line up the edges of the zipper and fabric for the first seam.  This wandered just a little on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 152px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SeamRipReflector.jpg" style="width: 152px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Seam ripping the reflector off, because I sewed it on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the seams in the pannier I used a nylon thread.  From what I have read, cotton can rot and the nylon fibers of the Cordura will cut polyester.  I used heavy duty nylon thread through out the pannier construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 285px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SideReflector.jpg" style="width: 285px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side reflective tape combo picture, low light without flash fading into flash picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step for the larger side piece is sewing on the reflector strips, made from 3M reflective fabric tape.  I located them so they would be halfway up the side.  Also, don’t get distracted and sew the reflector on the wrong side.  Surely no one would be that stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was concerned about the exposed edge of the reflective tape at first. After sewing a piece to a scrap of fabric and scratching over it for quite a while with my fingernails, I was unable to get the tape to unravel any significant amount.  I think it should hold up fine without rolling over the top edges.  Any time the ends of the tape are exposed, however, they need to be folded under before being sewn.  For these side pieces, both edges will be covered by edging on one side and a seam to the back on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SidePieces.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Both piece of the side/top of the pannier.  These will run 3/4 of the way around the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a laugh out of the shot with the flash was on.  The reflective tape seems to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left you can see the two side pieces.  The smaller piece is finished, except for being joined to the front panel.  While it looks like it curves, this is only because of the zipper seam pulled that edge of the zipper together, making it shorter.  This will go away after you sew along the other side of the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 286px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSideWide.jpg" style="width: 286px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side parts showing edge detail for front and rear reflectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger piece has both piece of reflector tape sewn in place (on the correct side!).  One edge of the larger side piece will be exposed, because it is acts as a flap for the zipper.  I used 3/4” cross-grain nylon ribbon to treat the edge.  This looks much nicer than a raw edge and should also keep it from unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 144px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SecondZipperStitch.jpg" style="width: 144px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Both stitches on the large side piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it easier to sew this edge when I folded the tape and ironed it, before sewing.  By “I found it easier”, I mean by not ironing the ribbon in half, it is close to impossible to sew it nicely.  With it ironed, it is just really difficult.  I pined it in place every 6 inches or so, as I sewed the edge.  You can’t pin too far ahead, because the tape adjusts length a little as you sew.  This edge will also contain one of the exposed reflective tape ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSide.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Finished side pieces, zipped together.  The left side with the flap laying down as it will normally be to protect the zipper from debris and water.  The right side has the flap lifted to show the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish the large side piece, I ran a second stitch along the zipper.  I again used the zipper foot for one and regular foot for the other, to maintain consistent spacing.  I then installed the two zipper pulls.  When the pannier is closed, the two pulls will be together.  It will open like a back pack, with the two zippers pulling away from each other to make an opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is cutting out the front panel and joining it to the smaller of the side pieces.  The dimensions for the front panel are 19” x 13.25” (18” x 12.25” finished).   Again, you want to cut out the shorter dimension along the weft of the fabric, allowing the stronger warp threads to be vertical in the pannier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedFront.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front sewn to small side piece and zipper half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the piece is cut out and heat sealed, you join it to the shorter side piece on three edges, leaving one of the longer edges exposed to join with the back/bottom piece.  I lined up the pieces at the tip center, but sewed to as one long seam with two turns.  See the image of the finished side and front joined together.  All that is left is to sew in the back panel pouch, join the back on, cut the back panel, bent and install the aluminum support, and install the mounting hardware.  In other words, we aren’t even half way there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 400px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedFrontAndSide.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front and Side zipped together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add a mesh pocket for holding things I need while riding and drying wet stuff.  I could have done this along with the side seams to the front, but I wanted a smaller pocket.  I also wanted the bottom of this pocket to be a few inches above the bottom of the pannier to keep it from sagging down and possibly dragging in turns.  Both of these made sewing the pocket on a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedSideWithPulls.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Details of the dual zipper pulls, prior to joining the short side to the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister came over and got excited about the project.  Ruth is more experienced at sewing than I am, but this the first “industrial” sewing project for either of us.   She helped me figure out how to attach the mesh pocket.   I used elastic across the top, folded over and stitched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 426px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/PinningMeshPocket.jpg" style="width: 426px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pinning the mesh pocket onto the outside prior to sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sewed on the pocket with the same cross-grain ribbon I used on the zipper cover and mitered edges at the corner.  There were a few places that… umm… missed the tape.  But she re-did those.  I’m going for functionality, not beauty. Beauty wouldn’t be bad though.  I can’t say much, because she actually sewed them on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, I was fairly tough with the low power of my machine.  If I keep up this type of work, I’ll want to pick up a lightweight industrial machine.  A machine that sews straight with plenty of power is the best option.  We didn’t pull the elastic along the top enough with the first piece.  Sewing down elastic takes out some of the retracting capability.  One pocket will be slightly more loose than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other lesson learned is that it would have been easier to sew on the pocket before sewing the front to the sides.  On my second bag, I sewed the netting along with the front and side/top seams.  It turned out cleaner and was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUCH&lt;/span&gt; easier.  It also yields a larger pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One negative of this is the it sticks out a little more and can get damaged easier.  I have a small tear in mine from a slight drag with a little too much weight in the mesh pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SupportHolder.jpg" style="width: 370px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Internal pocket on the back side to hold the stiffener board.  Where the black nylon ends at the bottom is the transition from back to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut back/bottom piece at 19” x 21” (finished 18” x 12.25” back and 18” x 7.75” bottom.)  Again, this was heat sealed all around the edge.  The warp ran along the 21” direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before sewing onto the sides/top, I wanted to put in a pocked for the stiffener.  This was cut from lightweight black nylon and sealed, 19” x 13”.  The sides of the pocket will be sewn into the seams.  I rolled over and hemmed the top to get a clean edge.  I rolled over the bottom before sewing to the Cordura.  The top remains open to load in the support panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done much sewing, you know there is that one time when everything is going right.  You have been fighting seams all day and this seam is the best one so far.  It is straight and the fabric is laying perfectly.  That only means one thing, you bobbin just ran out of thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 186px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/EmptyBobbin.jpg" style="width: 186px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sew all you want, but when the thread runs out in the bobbin you are just punching holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sides of the back/bottom piece are sewn to the exposed edges of the front/sides/top piece.  I centered the sides/top piece along the top of the back/bottom piece and sewed that first.  This distributed the sides evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all simple seams of keeping the fabric aligned and sewing at the right offset.  However, because of all the hardware on the individual pieces, it takes some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 323px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/FinishedPannier.jpg" style="width: 323px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pannier with sewing finished, before support hardware was added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the side pocket, you can see a small strip of reflective tape.  Were I smart about it, I would have sewn this reflector along the entire edge of the front piece and into the seam at the side.  This would be a larger reflecting surface and eliminate the need to fold over the ends of the tape to sew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 234px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/PlasticSupport.jpg" style="width: 234px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;1/8” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDPE&lt;/span&gt; plastic sheet for hook support mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attentive reader might also have figured out that these pannier could be made with a single piece for the back, bottom, and front.  I had thought of this at first, but decided the likely hood of me lining everything up correctly with essentially two “U” shaped pieces of fabric (with the sides/top and the back/bottom/front) might be zero.  My main concern was the unknown zipper seam offset.  This would vary the thickness and make the bottom piece width vary.  However, if you sewed together the side/top pieces and them measured the finished width, you could easily create a one piece back/bottom/front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.arkel-od.com/en/bicycle-accessories.html"&gt;hook kit from Arkel&lt;/a&gt; for mounting the panniers to the bike.   This consists of two hooks up top, with a cam locking mechanism that locks the hooks onto the rack rail.  Then an elastic hook holds onto the bottom of the rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of this mounting method requires support inside the pannier.  My dad had a piece of 1/8” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDPE&lt;/span&gt; plastic that would work.  I used some cardboard to prototype the support size before cutting plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/OnBike.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Test fit in location on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scored the plastic with a razer knife and then folded it over to break the edge, similar to cutting drywall.   I used a jigsaw to round over the corners of the sheet, then I cleaned up the edges with sand paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 315px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/RoundingCorners.jpg" style="width: 315px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rounding the corners with a jigsaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounting requires two holes in the support panel.  I locked the clips on the rack and positioned the bag where I wanted it to mark the hole positions.  I used the soldering iron to melt through the back fabric and into the plastic, then drilled holes in the support.  Last, I melted the hole in the back fabric to match the size of the drilled hole.  I was careful to not melt into the nylon pocket material.  After I tightened the nylock nuts for the hooks, I made sure to clean off any edges that might cut in the pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last design element I borrowed from Arkel is the support rod.  This takes the force from the front of the pannier and distributes it to the back, where the hooks transfer the load to the bike.  If this rod was not installed, the weight in the pannier would allow the outside edge of the bottom to drop until the contents stopped compressing and the top and front took up the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 337px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SupportRod.jpg" style="width: 337px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Support rod bent from 1/4” solid 6061 aluminum.  It is important to keep the edges that meet the top of the pannier well radiused to spread the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rod is 1/4” 6061 solid aluminum rod.  We started bending at one edge.  First the piece that will go into the webbing pocket, next the section goes along the side, then the portion along the top, next the other side, finally the webbing pocket piece on the far side.  The side edge length isn’t critical, as long as they are equal.  They should be as long as possible, however, because that will reduce the angle it makes with the back.  The greater this angle becomes, the more force is pushed into the bike, rather than just down on the hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 473px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/TopRodHolder.jpg" style="width: 473px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Top rod holder sewed to the top/side.  It is mounted back enough that the force in not on the zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sewed in the top rod holder first.  This is the most critical one for positioning.  For material, I use a light weight 200 Cordura, which I had on hand.  It doesn’t match, but no one ever sees it.  After cutting the piece, I rolled over and stitched the shorter edges before sewing it into place.  Care should be taken to get this as parallel as possible with the back edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that when the piece is pulled out firmly, it does not reach the zipper.  If it does, extra force will be focused directly on the zipper.  I’ve talked with zippers quite a bit, they don’t like this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 355px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/pannier/SideRodHolder.jpg" style="width: 355px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;One side rod holder located at the bottom back. The other side is the same, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom holder consists of 3/4” nylon webbing, which is folded over and stitched along the edge to form a pocket.  You don’t have to get the exact length right, but you want to get the fold correct.  Once you sew this portion, you can cut the overall length to leave just a small margin to sew it to the bag.  To find the position for these, install the rod inside the top holder and mount the pannier on the bike.  Fake some force in the pannier top and figure out where it needs to me positioned to get the top level with some force on it.  If you didn’t get the two sides equal when bending the rod, here is where you correct any small problems.  Just make sure to mark the rod so it goes in the same way each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my bag is much wider than the pannier I modeled this after, I wanted to beef up the support.   I cut and added the 45 degree webbing reinforcement when I sewed the pocket.   With that, I was done.   I put it on the bike and loaded it down to ride for a few days.  I was worried that I would have to tie directly to the plastic sheet, but even after touring for months the attachment I used was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my 70+ days on the bike, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joesacher.com/category/trans-am.html"&gt;during my Trans-Am tour&lt;/a&gt;, I learned a few things.  The overall design and construction was sound.  The bags are pretty decent at shedding water and held up pretty well to carrying the bulk of my touring load.  A few things didn’t work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I under estimated the tilt angle that I might need to make on the bike, after the bags sagged slightly with heavy load.  I would use 60 degrees as a measure next time, instead of 45 degrees.   Obviously, if you make them shallower, this becomes less of a factor as well.  This was augmented by the second problem, the bottom drooped.  Not  all loads I put in there were a flat 18” x 7” pieces of baggage.  I don’t think any were.  This causes the bag to get close enough to the ground that I did touch a few times at speed.  Cordura fabric is considered abrasion resistant.  However they aren’t talking about the type of abrasion that pavement gives at 40 mph on a downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad met me two times on tour and I had him bring some equipment to solve these problems.  We glued some light aluminum sheet to the outside rear edge, where I occasionally touched down, to form skid plates.   We also put some corrugated plastic sheet in the bottom of the pannier.   I oriented the channels along the short axis to keep the bottom from curving as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process was a great learning experience that I would only do again if I couldn’t find something commercially available close to what I wanted.  It is nice to personalize things, but these bags were a great deal of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/book-review/white-out.jpg" style="width: 161px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book I happened on by chance.  I picked it out of the new book section of the library by the title and checked it out after reading the inside cover.  I’m glad that I did.  While I only rate it 4 out of 5, it was an interesting book and worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is centered on telling the story of a Royal Navy officer and his trials to survive against impossible odds.  The main story is set during the Second World War on the continent of Antarctica.  The British Royal Navy sends a small force to establish a weather station while also carrying out a top-secret mission.  A German U-Boat intercepts the periodic weather forecasts and is able to triangulate the stations position.  The station is attacked when the protagonist and a junior man are off taking core samples.  Upon returning, they find the station totally destroyed and the commander barely clinging onto life.  As they race for the northern peninsula, the adventure begins.  If they don’t make it in time, the ice will make rescue impossible.  And a winter without a proper shelter is impossible to survive in this harsh continent.  In the end, only one man survives.  He claims to have lost his memory of the events before his rescue and he longs to return.  Then we are able to learn why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often wondered why anyone would want to visit or live in Antarctica.  It seems like a barren place, devoid of life.  But this book has shown me the beauty and wonder of that most untouched of our continents.  I did not realize the amount of life existing during the summer months, that can exceed almost all other places on earth during the peak.  It was truly a memorable story that was as shocking at time as it was touching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one complaint that I have about the book.  It seems quite petty, but it was a major detraction as I was really getting into it.  The setting is 1942.  I am in a mindset of World War Two.  All surrounding are described with the technology available then.  The tent material wasn’t modern day synthetics.  However, the penguins jumping over a 5 feet ridge are described as “jump jets”.  This really hit me wrong.  I was taken out of the 1940’s mindset and propelled back to modern day, with one poorly chosen metaphor.  This is a minor issue and you will certainly enjoy the book.&lt;/p&gt;

It is similar to a Pecan Pie, but with a little more body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ingredients"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 frozen pie shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 stick of butter, melted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon vinegar (Apple Cider type is best)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup raisins (gold or regular)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup chopped nuts (normally use pecans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup coconut (shredded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="directions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ochef.com/955.htm"&gt;Blind bake&lt;/a&gt; the 9” pie shell, according to the package instructions.  The pie is really moist and without this step, the crust doesn’t get done.  The trick with blind baking is not burning the outer crust, when you finish the bake with the filling.  You either don’t bake the crust as much, or use a Pie Crust Shield.  Also be carefuly to watch the sides of the pie crust, as they tend to slide into the pie tin.  I hand crimp the edges down, after thawing the frozen pie shell.  (This also makes it look more like you made the shell too.  Is that cheating?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Fully mix melted butter and sugar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Mix in vinegar, vanilla, eggs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(make sure butter isn’t too hot, you don’t want to cook the eggs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Add the raisins, nuts and coconut and mix until uniform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Dump everything into the pie shell and level it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Bake at 300 degrees for 40-50 minutes.  The top should be uniformly browned and the center firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this pie is great the day it is baked, it gets better if put inside a gallon sized ziploc freezer bag and frozen.   Something with the freezing of the pie makes the flavors meld together better.  For a really handy pie, cut it before freezing.  Then you can grab it out of the freezer and take it when you need to bring a dessert.   The pie is really hard to cut when frozen, but the pieces get soft very quickly when served.  The pie doesn’t loose its flavor even after a few months in the deep freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="variations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important parts of the recipe are the butter, sugar and egg.  Just like a pecan pie, the egg cooks and gels the pie together.  I tend to like a little more coconut than the recipe and a little more pecans.  Variations on fruit such as dried cherries instead of raisins are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also made this into a bar with a flat dough on parchment paper that it blind baked, then a layer of the filling on top.  Let cool for a while before cutting. These turned out well and were a smaller portion of this rich dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Having completed the trip, the question became easy to answer.  It was not as easy to answer before I left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a bicentennial baby, born in 1976.  This is the same year the Bikecentennial route was created as a celebration of our 200 years as a country.  Thousands of cyclists rode across the country on that route during the innagural year.  Many thousands more have crossed the United States on the same route since.  The route is still maintained by the same organization with a new name: Adventure Cycling.  Their maps are extremely helpful for the bicycle tourist and have kept the same basic route, with slight changes as roads are modified over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is well and good, you say, but it still doesn’t answer the why.  The truth is that I didn’t really know.  I read a tour report on-line and thought it sounded interesting.  Over the years it fermented into a strong desire.  I wondered if this was something I could do.  I started riding a Trek 520 touring bike in college.  I was overweight.  No nicer way to say it.  Riding 50 miles in a day was a task.  This wasn’t because I couldn’t physically do it, my butt just couldn’t handle the time on the bike.  Yes, I had the real bike shorts.  I tried three different seats.  It just didn’t work.  All season would be required before I could do two back to back 50 mile days.  I couldn’t see myself riding across the country, when you are doing 50+ mile days, every day.  The idea was put on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working at Office Depot as a Business Machine Specialist, while in High School.  Lower hours during the school year and full weeks during the summer, I didn’t have much time off.  When High School turned to college, I worked as much as I could to help pay for school.  Added to that a challenging Engineering curriculum and there wasn’t much time off.  Then I started work at a consulting company, pulling crazy hours and throwing myself into my work.  The reality was that I needed to get a life, but I didn’t realize it at the time.  I had work and not much else.  Work was challenging and I enjoyed it, but I was burning myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, I ran into a man on a recumbent bicycle.  The man’s name was Pete, something I didn’t know until months later when we became friends.  I asked him so many questions that he graciously answered.  Soon after that encounter, I purchased my first recumbent.  It would be the first of many to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With recumbents came pain free riding.  They allow you to ride a bicycle, while you sit in a lazy boy recliner.  I started easily riding 50 miles.  I rode a century (100 miles) without much problem.  I thought back to the first century I rode on an old mountain bike without road tires.  That experience is currently in Webster’s as a definition for pain.  I had trouble walking for a day or two after that.  With the recumbent century, I just had sore legs and nothing else hurt.  This was the way to ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having a way to ride across the country, I began to seriously consider it.  I didn’t know if I could actually make it all the way across, physically.  That became another reason to do it, just to see if I could.  This is the same reason people have climbed mountains and explored new realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the discovery of recumbents was occurring, I started consulting for an Internet startup in my day job.  Working 6 and 7 days a week for 80+ hours each week can take a toll.  It was challenging and I enjoyed the work, but I was getting further burned out.  I needed a vacation that I didn’t feel like I’d had since High School.  I saved up so much vacation time, it was ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally set a date for the trip and told my boss that I would need 4 months off work.  I told him that I would like to come back to work, but would take the time off regardless of a job waiting for me or not.  I had over a month of vacation to use and knew I would get a few more paychecks during the trip, even if I was forced to quit.  If I needed to find a new job when I got back, so be it.  I wound up with two months paid leave (I could pull forward vacation time from the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTO&lt;/span&gt; system in addition to my vacation) and two months without pay.  Then I would return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be bored with a description of all the small projects I was put on during the months before my departure.  I couldn’t do a full term project, because I wouldn’t be around.  As never happens (snicker), all the projects ran long.  Instead of getting ready for the trip, I was working serious overtime again.  I was getting burned out with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did I go?  Had I known the serious and life changing effect this trip would have on me, I would have come up with a better answer.  But the only answer I came up with is this: I had to go.  I needed those hours of uninterrupted thought.  I needed to figure out if I was doing what I wanted in life.  I needed to change something.  I needed to see if I could ride a bicycle across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had to go.  So I went.  And it changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My outlook on so many things is different.  The definition of what you actually need to live.  We think we need so much more than we do.  When life is a bicycle and what you can carry, you have to simplify and ration your belongings.  Each hill demands justification for every pound on the bike.  For all but the most seasoned bicycle tourists, the first few towns’ post office is a must stop location.  You have been on tour for some days and you can’t for the life of you understand why you brought this heavy, useless [fill in the blank].  Then be prepared to do the same thing in another few days, when yet another piece of equipment is voted off of the bicycle.  This is an event similar to backpackers, where common hostels and other meeting locations often have a place to leave things that others can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a month that goes by that I don’t long to be out on the road again for a while.  I am now over 5 years from my big trip and I still miss it.  The challenge was almost too much for me at first.  But it was an emotional triumph to persevere and conquer my weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience isn’t the same for everyone.  Many on the tour would have only goals in mind.  Finishing the tour in a certain amont of time.  This is often a necessity due to work schedules and other things.  I didn’t finish the trip, due to an accident.  But it didn’t matter, as my goal was touring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised when I would ask if others had seen the beautiful artesian well or stopped at the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Nope.  But we made our mileage in under 5 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who cares?  How full of experiences were those miles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true with life.  Are you living life to really live it or are to constantly striving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONLY&lt;/span&gt; towards goals and missing life?  Is your job and crazy hours caused by the things you surround yourself with and who know rule you?  Life can be as simple as a bicycle and being homeless.  Everything else is gravy.  But too much else is a millstone around your neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with a purpose and justify all the drains in your life.  Live simply.  Live happy.  Because doing otherwise isn’t really living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that by riding a bicycle across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBOrigDryBag.jpg" style="width: 205px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dry bag for inside panniers, purchased from Arkel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched without success for a lightweight, waterproof bag to protect my Martin Backpacker Guitar.  Typical dry bags used for water sports are overbuilt for bicycle touring and backpacking use, where weight is a very large factor.   They use clear vinyl or heavier vinyl coated cloth and weigh many pounds.  This article describes the process I went through to make my own custom lightweight waterproof bags for touring and backpacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- PELICAN_SUMMARY_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered a set of front panniers and some lightweight waterproof bags to use in the panniers from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.panniers.com"&gt;Arkel&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the “roll over and snap” type closure of the dry bags I received.  In these bags, I saw the perfect material to produce a travel guitar dry bag.   I asked Arkel about getting a custom bag made, but they turned me down.  Their supplier did not have the flexibility for a custom project.  The design of these bags is dead simple, so I decided to just make one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is my first attempt at making the bag and shows a large collection of what not to do if you attempt the same thing.   Hopefully there are enough tips that you will be successful.  You should be able to follow this page to make waterproof bags for any shape you want to, even simple squares. Although, If Arkel carried the size I wanted, I would probably just purchase it from them as the cost for materials and time to build a bag makes their prices really reasonable.  Just remember to leave the biggest side open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-fabric"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fabric&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had posted to the phred.org touring group (no long around) about waterproof bag material and was referred to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.therainshed.com/"&gt;The Rain Shed&lt;/a&gt;.  They turned out to be a very helpful resource on harder to find fabrics for outdoor gear.    I started with the huge sample set, knowing I would soon need additional material for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joesacher.com/blog/how-to/how-to-build-bicycle-panniers/"&gt;custom bicycle panniers I also had planned&lt;/a&gt;.  I purchased a small amount of some 70 Denier Taffeta and 200 Denier Oxford Heat Seal Fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 200 was almost exactly the same weight as my existing dry bags, and the 70 looked a little too light and would be puncture too easily.   It is more like a very thin jacket lining that would have addition reinforcement.  My bag would not have that luxury.  I ordered 2 yards of the 200, some 3/4” plastic side release buckles, and some 3/4” flat nylon webbing.  The dry bags from Arkel used 1” buckles, but 3/4” is sufficient, as there really isn’t any load on them and the smaller size allows for a tighter roll.  Get the thinnest webbing you can find.  Again, no force is really involved here and thinner webbing is easier to sew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-template"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 164px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTemplate.jpg" style="width: 164px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Cardboard template for dry bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 246px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTemplate2.jpg" style="width: 246px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dry bag material template beside guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taped together some cardboard pieces to create a template for the guitar.  The template is around 2 inches larger than the guitar.  This extra area is need for both the material to seal and the thickness of the guitar.  This was just a guess on my part, but make sure to guess bigger than needed.  It is easier to seal in further and cut off excess than to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used two small pieces of double stick tape to keep the template from shifting as I cut it.  I would have produced a more even and cleaner cut if I used masking tape around the edges and cut through it.  Just make sure when you cut the material that you don’t pull it.  The more you let it lay without tension, the more accurate you can follow the template. Years later, I started woodworking and found out about carpet tape.  This is a fiber backed extreme double stick tape.  It is all I use for most projects, instead of the cheap foam tape shown in the pictures.  You can find it at most big box stores, such as Lowes, Home Depot, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 221px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBDblStickTape2.jpg" style="width: 221px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A few pieces are all you need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 202px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBDblStickTape.jpg" style="width: 202px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Standard Foam Double-Stick tape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guitar looks just about right laying over the first side cut out.  I set up for cutting the second side with my template same side up as it was in the last cut. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;’T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAY&lt;/span&gt;!  I was lucky that my template was fairly symmetrical, but I had to twist the bag at certain places to make the sides line up when sealing.  If you flip it over when cutting the second side, they should like up perfectly.  In other words, act like the template edge of the open side is a hinge when flipping the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 90px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBCutOne.jpg" style="width: 90px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First cut&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Making the second cut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I did this again, I would make a half template and use that to create the full template.  With the band saw I now have access to, I would make it out of cheap 1/8” material, allow me to cut it out with a hot soldering iron or hot knife.  This would eliminate the need to seal the edges later, and I could have cranked out a couple and probably sold them (if the reaction to this tutorial is any judge of that.)  My biggest mistake on this was not taking my time to make a good and symetrical template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be useful to make a heat seal template that was 1/2” smaller all around.  This would allow you to iron and press into the template and get a uniform seal (unlike my first failure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sealing the Edge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;What the sealed edge looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on my standard household iron and started sealing the bag.  (It was happy to be used for a change.  I love wash and wear fabrics and like to keep the iron on a shelf.)  I had played with a few scrap pieces before I started and I recommend you do the same.  The best setup I found was around 5 or 6 (my iron has 1-9) and moving a little slow.  Be sure to practice the sock technique described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first sealing attempt, I test fit the guitar.   I couldn’t have done it better if I actually &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DID&lt;/span&gt; know what I was doing. I noticed some less than satisfactory seals.   Forcing open the inside with your hand allows you to see how far in the seal has taken.  The orange arrow points out a section not sealed almost all the way out to the edge.  A good bit of this is because of the twisting that was required, because of the asymmetrical template.  Taking time on the template construction or flipping over the template when cutting out these pieces will eliminate some of this.  You are shooting for about a 1/2” of seal or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 134px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTestFit.jpg" style="width: 134px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Example of a bad seal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some problems getting the wrinkles to seal.  The ironing board cover I was using is too soft and it didn’t hold the bottom sufficiently.  I worked slowly over the entire edge and did the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I thought that bag was sealed perfectly, wanted to test it.  How do you measure how much water gets into a bag holding something?  That is pretty hard to do.   But you can test how well it holds water.  I took it to the bathroom and filled it with water.   If it is can hold in water it should keep water out, right? As you can see, I had a problem. My haphazard method of sealing the edges needed some improvement.  I hung up the bag to dry out and try again at the sealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 259px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBLeak.jpg" style="width: 259px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Not quite there, bag is leaking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBDrying.jpg" style="width: 122px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Drying bag after water test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the drawing board.  There were two problems with my method of sealing.  First, I couldn’t rub down the edge behind the iron, because the heat seal coating really retained heat and it burned my fingers.  Solution: I just put a sock on my hand and rubbed directly behind the iron.  Second, my ironing board is too soft and the bottom fabric isn’t forced up against the top to heat up its sealing material.  Solution: I used a large piece of standard corrugated cardboard under the bag when ironing.
I should also note that it is a good idea to do some tack seals.  By that I mean do something similar to what welders do with tack welds.  Lay the bag out and use the iron to seal small sections every couple inches.  This keeps the edges from going out of alignment when you run the full “weld” down the edge.  It was at this point I realized how skewed my bag was from making a bad template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 340px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSock.jpg" style="width: 340px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Using sock to rub down the hot edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing the second sealing, I put in the guitar and trimmed the bag length down. You want to have enough length to be able to roll up the end three of four times and then make the ends touch. The bag will close like the first picture at the top of this page.  It is safer to leave the bag a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 308px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBTrimLength2.jpg" style="width: 308px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rolling up bag to check length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing a better seal, the bag was water tight.  If I ran out of water bags, this would work in a pinch. I trimmed off where the two sides didn’t match up.  This is yet another reason to take time on a good template.  If you were perfect in cutting out and lining up your side, you can skip this part.   That is an easier method by far, as it is much easier to judge the true seam width if both sides are lined up before sealing.  The sizable pile of scraps when I finished up was a testimony to how poorly I did.  Time to dry out the bag again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attaching-the-clips"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attaching the Clips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 193px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSolderIron.jpg" style="width: 193px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Melting edges of webbing to keep from unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 175px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSewOn2.jpg" style="width: 175px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sewing the clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bag dried, I cut webbing pieces for attaching the clips to the bag.  With a low temperature soldering iron, I slightly melted the edges of the webbing to keep it from unraveling after the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attach, you just fold the webbing around the top edge of the dry bag and sew a zigzag stitch forward and backwards a few times.  I tested out the setting with a spare piece of webbing and on of the dry bag section I had cut off.   You need to get the length close., as your seam should be sew over  the location where the  bag is already sealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 253px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBClip.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;How to attach the clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sew into the unsealed area, you reduce the opening size in the bag and introduce many pin holes where the bag can leak.  This isn’t a large factor  in the water tightness of the bag, because of the multiple rolls.  However, I believe that having edges of a zig-zag stitch on the inside would be more likely to tear out than the uniform sealed edge.  This is a place that will be stress each time the bag is open.  It is safest to just keep the seam over the sealed region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 282px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBSewOn.jpg" style="width: 282px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Clip sewn on the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both clips sew on, I am now finished.  To use the bag, you just put the guitar in, roll down the top and clip the clips together.  One thing I noticed when sewing the webbing on is the tendency for the bottom piece to walk, when the feet try to move the material.  Start the first full section of stitches by hand to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 347px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBFinished.jpg" style="width: 347px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Finished bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut the bag for length before the second sealing.  Didn’t try to fit it after the second sealing until after I sewed on the buckles.  I was so concerned with water tightness that I sealed in almost an inch, instead of the 1/2” that I originally wanted.  This created a serious problem, as my guitar will no longer slide in the bag all the way.  I sealed it really good this time, so it doesn’t want to come apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 335px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/drybag/DBWontFit.jpg" style="width: 335px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Over sealed, so now it won’t fit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops!  I knew this first one wasn’t going to be pretty, but I assumed it would work.  That is why I bought 2 yards.  I have used less than a 1/2 yard so far and this first attempt can be turned into a waterproof cell phone case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="post-script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was written a few years ago.  I wound up not taking the Backpacker guitar with my on my bike tour.  I also no longer own this guitar or bag.  This shouldn’t keep you from making your own, however.  The one problem with this bag is the possibility of puncturing the bottom, there the neck inserts.  Cut off strings are very sharp.  My solution for this was to get a very thick wool sock that fit over the tuners.  This did two things, first it protected the water proof integrity of the bag.  This sock also protected the exposed tuners, a second unintended consequence.  Good luck if you take on this project.  With a little work, you can have a nice dry bag for any custom application that should last a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Drive into Berkley Plantation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkley Plantation was my second stop of the day.  I should point out to anyone wanting to try this route themselves that the 1/2 mile ride into Berkley is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TERRIBLE&lt;/span&gt;.  You see the sign that asks you to enjoy yourself for the next 1/2 mile of authentic Colonial road and you get to try as hard as you can to keep the bike upright.  That is one of the toughest roads I have ever ridden on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/berkley/3922-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/berkley/3922-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Stones making up the wobbly road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a gravel road with very round rocks.  The rocks very in size from sand to 4 inches.  Did I mention the 5-15 degrees of slope for drainage?  That is good for flipping your back wheel out whenever it feels like it.  Yee-haw, I have now surfed a bike and am immensely impressed with myself for not going down once.  This surfing experience would prove almost enough practice for a situation later in the trip, but we will have to wait for that.  Despite the challenge getting in and out, I believe the ride was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/berkley/3879-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/berkley/3879-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the site of the first official Thanksgiving in 1619.  Benjamin Harrison &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; built the mansion on the land in 1726 and married Anne Carter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the birthplace of Benjamin Harrison V, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.  This was also the birthplace of William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States, and ancestrial home of his grandson, Benjamin Harrison, the twenty-third President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Civil War, the plantation was occupied by General George McClellan’s Union troops.  General Daniel Butterfield composed “Taps”, played by his bugler, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;O.W.&lt;/span&gt; Norton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture is original and the furnishings are of the period when it was built.  The basement contains a mini museum, with paintings and exhibits describing the history of the plantation.  This also was a tour worth seeing, given by enthusiastic guides in period outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sign from Hwy 5 (John Tyler Memorial Highway)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood Forest was the first plantation I visited today along Hwy 5.  It holds a few distinctions, such as the only private residence having been owned by two unrelated presidents.  William Henry Harrison inherited the property in 1790 and sold it in 1793 without having every lived in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3784-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3784-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Center portion of the main house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where John Tyler, the tenth (1841-1845) President of the United States retired, after purchasing the property in 1842.  Sherwood Forest Plantation has been owned by the Tyler family continuously, since John Tyler purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3788-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3788-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rear center of the main house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1616 land grant, this plantation was called Smith’s Hundred.  Sometime the name was changed to Walnut Grove, showing reference to many trees on the property.  The house was built in 1720 and is a classic example of Virginia Tidewater design.  This consists of a large house, small house, and kitchen.  It had many owners until Tyler purchased the home and 1,600 acres in 1842.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3789-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3789-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Overseer’s House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he purchased the property from his cousin, Collier Minge, he was still in the White House.  He renamed the plantation to “Sherwood Forest” as a reference to his reputation as a political outlaw by the Whig party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3817-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3817-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Shot down the length of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house originally had two separate out buildings, because doing wash and preparing food required fire.  It is much nicer to have a kitchen or laundry burn down than lose the entire residence.  These three buildings were eventually joined with great halls.  Unfortunately, no photography is allowed inside the home.  The tour contained many interesting artifacts, beautiful furniture, and grand rooms.  It is definitely worth taking if you come to the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3825-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3825-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the home is currently an actual residence, so you are not allowed to see the entire building.  However, one hall is part of the tour and you can see how it was laid out to accommodate the popular dance of the time: the Virginia Reel.  Due to these halls joining the home into one structure, it has the distinction of being one of the longest private residences in the country at 300 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3827-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3827-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Tyler was the first vice president to fill the role of presidency after the death of William Henry Harrison.  He was previously twice Governor or Virginia, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Senator, a member of the House of Representatives, a Virginia state senator, and Viriginia House delegate.  He re-entered public service as a member of the Confederate Congress of the COnfederate States of America in 1861.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood Forest was damaded during the Civil War by Union soldiers in 1864.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3831-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/sherwood-forest/3831-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grounds holds more than eighty varieties of trees, in the 25 acres of serence woodlands, terraced gardens and lawn.  Many trees are hundreds of years old and 29 not indigenous to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.  This includes a gingko tree given to Tyler by Captain Matthew Perry returning from the Orient in the 1850s.  This retintroduced gingko trees to America.  The walking tour of all the various species is a nice diversion around the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="floatclear"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smoke House was used from 1740’s to mid 20th century for curing hams.  The plantation provided all the food for the family, house servants, and field hands.  At butchering time, meats were bedded in salt, hung from the rafters and smoked by smoldering hickory logs behind selaed doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="floatclear"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Shingle Maker was patented in 1878.  Local cypress trees used to make shingles for all buildings on the plantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Loaded and ready to go, once I stow my drying shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a good night’s sleep, despite the temperature.  I thought about not bringing my 20 degree bag and purchasing a warmer weather bag to take up less space and weight.  I’m thrilled that I didn’t talk myself into it.  I needed every bit of that bag to stay warm last night.  I woke just before 7, refreshed and with my headache gone.  I’m sure that drinking water throughout the night helped counter the dehydration and altitude effects.  I immediately went to get my $22 worth of hot shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3756-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3756-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First campsite of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing my campsite for the first time in the light assured that I didn’t do too bad of a job picking it out.  The layer of pine needles and leaves added a nice soft accentuation to the Thermorest air mattress.  I setup my laptop and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AA&lt;/span&gt; batteries to charge in the outlets along the wall of the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky was hard overcast in the early morning, so I wondered about today’s weather.  I tuned in the local &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt; weather band station and listened to the monotonous voice repeating the current and forecasted weather.  The report kept using the phrase “unseasonably cool”.  Yes, I’d agree with that.  The forecast was partly cloudy with a chance of light showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3757-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3757-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Getting my oatmeal breakfast going on my camp stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small radio I brought along with me can receive all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt; weather radio stations, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; station audio.  I knew that I would be in some places far from civilization and thought it my best chance if getting useful information on the trip.  Like my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, Camera, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player it runs on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AA&lt;/span&gt;’s.  My 4 bay charger for the NiMH &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AA&lt;/span&gt;’s runs off of 12V, either directly from my large NiCd pack on the bike frame, or via an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; wall adaptor.  My Libretto laptop also charges off of 12V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3758-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3758-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Eating breakfast and listening to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to Morning Edition on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt; and started oatmeal on the stove.  It was a cold morning and I didn’t move very fast, because I didn’t relish the thought of adding a 12 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPH&lt;/span&gt; wind chill to the current temperature when I started riding.  I mixed a sports drink from some powder and wished I had thought to pack a tea bag or hot chocolate.  But then I thought this was the start of summer and I would only want cool drinks.  The oatmeal with raisins was tasty.  Their addition of heat inside me was even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3759-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3759-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pecked open hole in bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pre-packed some oatmeal in the snack sized Ziploc bags, before I left.  This was about the right size for a morning meal.  As I left to clean up the pot, one of these bags full of oatmeal sat on the picnic table.   I spent at most 3 minutes in the restroom, which was enough time for a crow to peck into a bag and start eating my oatmeal.  Glad I still had the first bag, I dumped the remaining oatmeal in there and chuckled.  A very fast opportunistic scavenger.  He was able to get quite a bit down, and even more scattered around the table where he will be able to claim once I’m gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3764-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3764-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gradually finished breaking down camp and getting ready for the day.  I left the campground just before 10, starting my first real touring day.  I stopped at the camp store to pick up some snacks on the way out.  The trick is to carry enough so you don’t go hungry, but every bit you carry is going up every hill you meet.  So you error only slightly on the side of too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3766-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3766-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First Route 76 sign I saw during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My route followed highway 5 towards Richmond for a majority of the day.  I was still in a somewhat high population area and there was a considerable amount of dump truck and semi-truck traffic along the road in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most drivers were courteous, I’m sure having seen quite a few Trans-Am bicycle tourists over the years.  A couple people passed when it wasn’t really safe, but a few always do.  I waved at all the truckers I passed, trying to build up my trucker karma for those nasty coal trucks I keep hearing about in eastern Kentucky.  I’m surprised that I haven’t seen a dog yet.  In 80 miles of cycling that is pretty strange.  I guess I will have to wait for those infamous eastern Kentucky dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3773-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3773-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; Sub Shop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to learn something positive about eastern Kentucky, as those are the only two things I know about it:  terrible trucks with bad drivers and terrible dogs.  That is the only thing bicycle tourists riding through there talk about.  I’m determined to find something nice about the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3772-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3772-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Lunch for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was the first time I noticed the 76 bike route signs, marking the Bikecentennial route I was riding, started in 1976.  I started taking some pictures of the sign when I spotted them.
I still have the chance to head back to Williamsburg, but I didn’t even consider it.  I wanted to get further away from the traffic and on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3847-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3847-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had considered stopping to have a few of the snacks I picked up at the camp store and was happy to see the sub shop at 11:30.  I devoured a pretty good hot turkey and cheese sub, fries and a Pepsi.  I told myself I would eat better on this trip, but it was really good!  With each stop, the basics are always handled.  Fill up your water bottles and get rid of the water you drank during the last couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3769-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3769-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;I’ve got a few miles to Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 249px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3765-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3765-s.jpg" style="width: 249px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had seen the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt; at restaurants and stores during my two days in Virginia.  I wound up researching this after the trip was over and leanred that it stands for Alcoholic Beverage Control.  Apparently, after prohibition ended, states came up with various systems to tax and control alcoholic beverage sales.  In an alcoholic beverage control state, the state is essentially a monopoly and operates stores where retailers can purchase their liquor to sell.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; means the location has a license to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt; means the location can sell alcohol for you to take away.  While interesting to figure out, this really didn’t concern me much, not being a drinker of much stronger than soda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3768-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3768-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Charles City County, perhaps one of the most confusing County names I’ve come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was Sherwood Forest Plantation in Charles City County.  This is the first of 4 major and many minor Plantations within 14 miles along highway 5.  See the upcoming side trip post for more information and pictures.  I spent about an hour touring the grounds before heading out again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3844-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3844-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Half of the father/daughter team that pass me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was passed by a father and daughter team, also doing the Trans-Am.  They were running light for the first day, with no bags.  They mentioned that a vehicle was bringing them.  I didn’t gather if they were heading all the way unloaded, or just for the start.  Either way, I will probably never catch back up with them.  Loaded touring is much more effort than doing joined day rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then stopped at Berkley Plantation, directly on the James River.  This land is home to many of America’s firsts, including the first Thanksgiving on Dec. 4th, 1619.  See the side trip post for more details of this visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3767-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3767-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the Berkley Plantation after 5:30 and headed to Glendale.  I stopped on the way to pick up some food for dinner.  This has been an interesting transition already.  The grocery stores available are a far cry from the huge supermarkets we get used to in modern life.  Tonight’s dinner was plucked from a small gas station and grocery.  The selection was poor, but the cyclist was hungry.  Hunger makes anything taste great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-2/3955-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-2/3955-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The residence of the Methodist minister, a landmark of the Battle of Malvern Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En route to Willis United Methodist Church, I stopped at the location for the last of the Seven Days Battles, Malvern Hill.  It is amazing how dense history is packed along this stretch of road.  That was a large factor of why this route was chosen for the Trans-Am trail during the planning in 1974-5.  What I am seeing is only a small fraction of what is around.  While riding a bike, it is a simple thing to pull off and read a sign noting some historical significance.  Nearly all of these would have been missed in a car and the small paragraph on each sign doesn’t come close to covering the historical significance of the location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Willis Church Historical Plaque&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Manning Harrell was a wonderful host, when I pulled into the Church around 8:30.  We had a chance to chat, while I was setting up camp.  He is retiring at the end of this month, and he has really enjoyed meeting all the cyclists in the five years he has been at the church.  Apparently the new pastor is also excited about hosting cyclists, so this fine overnight stop on the trail will be going strong for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Dave Knight (left) and my dad (right) about to pilot the Baron from Bowman Field in Louisville, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KY&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bicycle tourist is greeted with two choices when starting their tour.  Do I ride away from my home or pack up everything and take alternate transportation to the start?  For local tours, the loop method is a good idea.  Start off in one direction and ride in a big loop until you end up back home.  If I had a year’s time, not just a couple months, I would enjoy a loop tour of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.  It would be ideal to leave Indiana, riding in the northern states during the warmer months and the southern states during the cooler months.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have the few extra weeks it would take to get to Virginia.  My dad has some good flying friends with access to a large enough plane to get us out to the start..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3717-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3717-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A cruising altitude in the Baron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave is a part owner of a Baron twin engine aircraft with enough space for me, my father, Dave, and my gear.  Dad and I arrived at Bowman Field in Louisville, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KY&lt;/span&gt; around noon.  We loaded up the plane as soon as Dave arrived.  The local Air Traffic Controllers allowed us to depart a little past 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day had a dreary cast, under a solid fluffy blanket of clouds.  An occasional mist hit the windshield and we sampled small rain showers, on the climb to our cruising altitude.  Due to icing at our intended altitude of 11,000 feet, Dave asked for and was cleared up to 13,000 feet.  The Baron is not a pressurized cabin, so air pressure inside is the same as the air pressure outside.  This requires oxygen for the pilot, above 10,000 feet.  Oxygen is required for other members of the plane for altitudes above 14,000 feet for short times and lower altitudes for longer durations.  There were only two sets of oxygen, so Dad and I switched off.  I went more without than with, because Dad wanted to do some of the flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave me a chance to practice a pressure breathing technique I had read about for those entering high altitude environments without supplemental oxygen.  The problem isn’t with the percentage of oxygen in the air at higher altitudes; it is a problem with the pressure of the air in your lungs.  The lower pressure means less total volume of air, and therefore less total volume of oxygen.  The low pressure also doesn’t help with pressing the oxygen molecules into your blood stream via your lungs.  The pressure of air in your lungs can be increased by forcing your lips together, while your diaphragm muscles force the air out.  This technique would later prove beneficial when climbing over Hoosier Pass in the Rocky Mountains.  It helped things somewhat, but I was always ready for the oxygen when it was offered.  There were a few times that I became slightly woozy, with just the very beginning stages of hypoxia.  It was an interesting experience, which gave me a headache that would last the rest of the day.  My slight dehydration was also a co-conspiritor in my cranial crankiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of flying over mountains I would soon see again was somewhat surreal.  The entire trip out took around 2 hours by plane.  The trip back to passing within 50 miles of home would take almost a month by bicycle.  Just when we descended through the cloud layer and opened up many photo worth scenes, I realized my spare batteries were packed out of reach in the back.  My camera went dead as Newport News Airport came within view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3719-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3719-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Unloading the plane at the Newport News Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shot am most annoyed for missing was the giant aircraft carrier.  It was a beautiful view and seemed bigger than the grass strip in Scottsburg, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt;, where dad taught me how to land our Aeronica Champ.  An F-18 is quite a different animal, with a stall speed nearly 5 times that number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed at the Newport New Airport just after 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;.  After taxing to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FBO&lt;/span&gt; (Fixed Base Operator, the “gas station” of an airport), we began unloading my bike and gear.  It took a few minutes to reassemble everything and get ready to ride over to the start.  Instead of doing that, one of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FBO&lt;/span&gt; employees was nice enough to give me a ride to the Yorktown Visitor’s Center.  So I loaded the bike into a van and went for a quick 9 mile ride.  By the end of the day, I was really happy that I didn’t need to spend almost an hour doing this ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3720-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3720-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Bike loaded and ready to tour, with one exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a second time assembling and loading the bike, then checking over everything, I was off to find the Victory Monument (official start of the Trans-American trail).  I stopped 100 feet later.  I couldn’t get my bike computer to work.  I hoped the sensor just got bumped away from the magnet on the spoke.  Any experienced cyclist has run into that one a few times.  I moved the magnet until it made a slight “whack” sound on the sensor, then backed away every so slightly.  But I still had no speed indicated, so that wasn’t the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered having to unwind the handlebars after we set the bike down out of the van.  Sure enough, the computer wires were ripped raggedly apart.  I’ll be in need of my first repair sooner than expected.  Anyone know where I can borrow a soldering iron, a little wire, and some heat shrink?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3721-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3721-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Timer based shot at the Victory Monument, with camera sitting on the ground due to unreliable “helpers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Top of the Victory Monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took some pictures at the Monument before heading for Williamsburg.  I attempted to get another tourist to take a picture of me, but could not locate anything when I reviewed the screen after they left.  I set it all up and they just needed to press the button.  I immediately saw the advantages of bringing a digital camera.  Had I been shooting film, I would have assumed the picture of my overweight self would have already been taken at the monument.  I learned how to use the self timer for the first time and a few seconds later I had the photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Ceremonial dipping of the tire in the… man this bike is heavy, nevermind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just past the Victory Monument, there is a road that doesn’t allow motor vehicles.  I found the first benefit of bicycle touring.  I rode along the 7 houses built over 200 years ago, when Yorktown was Virginia’s leading seaport.  Cannon fire damaged many of the buliding during the Seige of Yorktown, the last major land battle of the Revolutionary War, which ended on October 19, 1781.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3736-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3736-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;George Washington Memorial Highway (Hwy 17) crossing over the York River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After riders start at the Victory Monument, it is ceremonial to dip your back wheel in the York River as the Atlantic Ocean representative body of water.  I thought about that.  I tried to lift my bike.  I thought about carrying my bike over the sand and back.  Then I considered unloading it and making that slightly easier.  Then I just took another picture from a different angle and called it good.  I probably would have done it, if I had more time in the day.  But time was moving, so I needed to as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3740-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3740-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entering Colonial Parkway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonists named this river first Charles and then York, both as an honor to the Duke of York.  It was known to the Indians of the region as Pamunkey, a name still used by a smaller tributary of the York River today.  While only 26 miles in length, the tidal waters of the York River flow over the deepest natural channel of any Chesapeake Bay tributary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3741-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3741-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Mileage signs come so much slower than in a car, so I got excited each time I saw one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the York River is the site of Werowocomoco, an Indian village that was Powhatan’s “chiefest habitation” in the early period of the Jamestown settlement.  This was the location that John Smith was held prisoner in 1607.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride was really beautiful, but there were so many things to see that I needed to ride right past.  It was after 4 o’clock, with only 4 hours of sunlight left, and I had no clue where I was going to stay tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3745-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3745-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would learn that it is often easier to find places to stay in less congested areas (other than motels and hotels).  In the big cities, cars are king.  So was it most places here.  I pulled into the Williamsburg Visitor’s Center around 6:30, as everything was closing down.  I received pointers to the lower priced hotels in the area and where the restaurants were hiding.  My lunch wasn’t large before I left Jeffersonville and I was famished.  I found a Golden Corral.  There is a reason why there are few “All You Can Eat” buffets along the Trans-Am trail.  A cyclist can burn thousands of extra calories a day.  And buffets can go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3751-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3751-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant was breathing tourists in and out as I ate and read about the route ahead.  They all seemed to be taking their first gasps of vacation, after the school year finished.  As long as the food doesn’t run out, the best you can hope for is a busy buffet.  Food turned over faster, tastes better.  Hunger also has that effect on food.  While I enjoyed resting, reading, and people watching, I knew daylight was fading.  My choices were hotel or not.  The hotels were right here.  If I stayed in a hotel or motel, I could ride back into Williamsburg for a visit tomorrow.  But this is a bicycle tour, not a tourist trip.  I wanted to be some miles under my belt and away from all the people and traffic, so off I rode into the fading daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3752-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3752-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the restaurant a little after 8 towards Jamestown.  This was the best option I could come up with for the night.  Soon the darkness pushed back the day and stopped to rig for night riding.  I turned on my rear lights and flipped the switch on my “dashboard” to enable the headlight.  I knew these were going to be needed through out the trip, but didn’t think I’d be riding into the night during the first day out.  I finally pulled into the campground after 9 and was greeted with a $22 campsite!  That is quite a bit of dough for a plot of grass and the use of a shower and bathroom.  Supply and demand was in full force in Jamestown.  While I knew $22 wasn’t the most I would spend for a night, as I planned a few motel stays, I hoped it was the most I would ever spend for a campsite.  Oh well, where else am I gonna go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-1/3754-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-1/3754-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Faking sleep to take a picture on my outfit for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my tent pitched and shower taken, I fired up my little Libretto laptop and started typing up today’s journal entry.  This little laptop is about the size of a Disney packaged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHS&lt;/span&gt; movie.  The keyboard is smaller than normal and I had not yet adjusted to it.  The headache still hung around as I typed up my day’s journal, so I constantly sipped on water.  The color of my urine had assured me that I was still dehydrated or someone slipped a bunch of vitamin B into my food at the Golden Corral.  I assumed the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night was unseasonably cold.  Temperatures dropped to 34 over night.  My 20 degree mummy bag felt nice over the small Thermarest air mattress.  The full hood was too warm, but a small fleece cap was just right.  With my water bottles available for sipping a few times through out the night, I slept well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I completely loaded up my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket.  I’ve built many custom components to make it into a cross-country touring machine.  Unfortunately, I haven’t had as much time getting ready for the trip as I wanted.  Work pressed into taking far too much of my time, so both equipment and physical shape preparation was lacking.  I will just have to get in shape by doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this lack of preparation chewed up almost two weeks of my time off.  I spent a week getting my belongings into storage and moved out of my apartment.  I spent another week finishing equipment builds and other touring builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a data-fluidbox="" href="/images/trans-am/day-0/3664-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/trans-am/day-0/3664-s.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also finished up the code for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; based email journal and mailing list.  It may be hard to connect over the analog modem through my Star-Tac cell phone, even just to send updates.  So, hopefully I won’t have to fix code while on the road.  I can currently compose updates as an email to a certain address, which will post and distribute them when the email is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I will be flying out to Newport News Airport and making my way to the start of this adventure.  After more than two years of planning, it is really nice to get this started.  Hopefully I will think the same thing a week or two into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll see you on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Quick Prototype of Vision Seat “Camp Chair”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am almost fully equipped for touring on my Vision Recumbent with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOB&lt;/span&gt; trialer for cargo.  However, I really think a good camp seat would be nice. The only problem with that is the weight must go up the hills.  The seat on the Vision is removable by lossening the back mount and removing the bottom pivot mount.  This should take only a minute or so to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="figure align-right" style="width: 243px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/vision-seat-camp-chair/vs_qfront.jpg" style="width: 243px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Front Quarter view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am toying with the idea of making a chair bottom for it. This would need to be 6061 aluminum to allow for the welding, but it still might weigh more than it is worth.  Here is some early sketches that I am playing around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure" style="width: 266px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/posts/vision-seat-camp-chair/vs_qrear.jpg" style="width: 266px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rear Quarter view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seat bottom rear piece is a rectangle with the bottom a slightly oversized tube to allow it to pivot in the bottom triangle. This render shows the bottom folded how it would ride on the top of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOB&lt;/span&gt; trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This design never went past the 3D model stage. I now am using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RANS&lt;/span&gt; Rocket for touring, but I will keep this page here, in case someone else want to try this. Please let me know if you do! - Joe 05/23/01&lt;/p&gt;
