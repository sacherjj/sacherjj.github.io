      <title>Playing for Pizza by John Grisham</title>

      <description>I have to admit that I was intrigued when I read the summary of this book. A novel by John Grisham about a third string NFL quarterback, escaping his terrible past to play professional football in Italy. Nothing about lawyers? This sounds interesting, if not just to figure out why John didn&amp;rsquo;t write about lawyers.
Normally the novel isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as good, when an author writes completely out of their &amp;ldquo;comfort zone&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Treason by Don Brown</title>

      <description>This used to be offered as a free book for the Kindle and was one of many I added to my account after receiving my Kindle. (If its free, its for me, right?)
When reading the author &amp;ldquo;Don Brown&amp;rdquo; on the cover of this novel, I was mistaking it for a more famous Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code). As I read the military themes unfold, my mind then played further tricks on me as I made a connection with Dale Brown&amp;rsquo;s military styled novels as the author.</description>

      <title>H.M.S. Unseen by Patrick Robinson</title>

      <description>This is the second book by Patrick Robinson I could get my hands on. I really enjoyed reading Kilo Class and I enjoyed this book as well. It is set a couple years into the future, so Patrick gets to play with some technology that isn&amp;rsquo;t around quite yet.
The novel is an interesting story about a seriously skilled agent from Iraq. He infiltrated Israel&amp;rsquo;s navy and was trained as a submariner.</description>

      <title>Kilo Class by Patrick Robinson</title>

      <description>This book was an accident. I needed a new book to read, because I was going to be waiting for something. The cover looked like a decent military technological drama. Since Tom Clancy cannot write books as fast as I can read them, I thought I would give it a try. It was a decent choice.
The premise is that Russia wants to sell Kilo class submarines to China. At $300 million a boat, it is much needed income for Russia.</description>

      <title>On Writing by Stephen King</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing again. In the last few years, all my writing was on screenplay style for short films. Some of these we actually shot and produced, most just sit on my computer in final PDF form. Writing in screenplay format is different than novel, novella, or short story forms. Screenplay is all about dialog and character actions. There is no exposition of character thoughts. I think this experience makes you a stronger dialog writer, when you switch to fiction.</description>

      <title>Jet Mini vs PSI Turncrafter Pro</title>

      <description>When I was looking at lathes, I talked with many people who had tried and liked either the Jet Mini or the PSI Turncrafter Pro lathes. I could not find many that had used both, to get an idea of the differences between them. Now owning a PSI Turncrafter Pro and having taken a class and used a Jet Mini for 5 hours or so, I decided to summarize the differences.</description>

      <title>Bicycling Coast to Coast by Donna Ikenberry</title>

      <description>As soon as I realized that my recumbent would allow me to complete my dream of riding a bicycle across the country, I started research all over the web. While reading through the many trip reports of coast to coast touring cyclists, two things became clear.
First, I would be riding the TransAmerica Trail created by Adventure Cycling in 1976 (the year of my birth).
Second, I should purchase, read, re-read, and take along Donna&amp;rsquo;s book.</description>

      <description>This is a book I happened on by chance. I picked it out of the new book section of the library by the title and checked it out after reading the inside cover. I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I did. While I only rate it 4 out of 5, it was an interesting book and worth reading.
The book is centered on telling the story of a Royal Navy officer and his trials to survive against impossible odds.</description>

      <description>This book was an incredible read. Brian starts his trek by dipping his wheel in the Pacific Ocean and heading east.
Follow Brian across the United States and learn of his internal conflicts and pressures that time alone on a bicycle set free. Raised in a fundimentalist Christian home, he is searching for the method of understanding his relationship with his father and his spirituality.You do not have to ride a bicycle to enjoy this book.</description>

      <description>I have not found a way to better describe this book than the first sentence inside the dust cover. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s as if Dave Barry and Charles Kuralt squeezed together onto a bicycle to pedal across America and around the world, filing outrageous dispatches along the way.&amp;rdquo;
Indeed, many times while reading I felt as if I was watching the well done Sunday morning stories where the common man or the small town are shown in all of their glory.</description>

      <description>The Da Vinci Code was the first book of Dan Brown&amp;rsquo;s I read. It seemed like your only choice was to read the book, due to popularity. I really enjoy Brown&amp;rsquo;s style of writing, but didn&amp;rsquo;t like the far stretches required to make The Da Vinci Code a suspenseful novel and much of the false history. I guess it didn&amp;rsquo;t really bug me when reading the book. The thing that bugged me was people thinking it was the truth after reading a fictional novel.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, you can no longer win $15,000 by reading this book. It was the announcement of the solution to the 10 cipher challenges, located in the back of The Code Book, that made me aware of this book. Money aside, if you are interested in learning of the history of codes and ciphers, this book is for you!
Did you know that Mary Queens of Scots was killed by Queen Elizabeth, because her code was not strong enough to foil the code breakers of the time.</description>

      <description>I really wish I had ran into this book before I purchased my &amp;ldquo;utility&amp;rdquo; sewing machine. I got a no frills home machine with a few stitches. It was a floor model, but I would have been better to spend the money on a light weight industrial sewing machine with only a straight stitch. Louise was talking about me when she mentioned those who buy a machine with all of these cool stitches.</description>

      <title>The Bicycle Wheel by Jobst Brandt</title>

      <description>I have just finished building my first rear wheel using The Bicycle Wheel as a guide. This book will teach you the technical aspects of the bicycle wheel in both structural principles and practical methods. After a couple hundred miles on my new wheel, it is still true as an arrow.
This book debunks myths and gives you the confidence to repair, build, and rebuild wheels. I can honestly say that I no longer fear any wheel repairs.</description>
